twrs299,,CabinCreekChronicle.jpg,Cabin Creek Chronicles: The History of the Most Remote Ranch in America,"Minshall, G.W.","Cabin Creek Chronicle is a non-fictional account of the key activities that occurred at a little known but historically significant place in the rugged mountains of central Idaho from the mid 1800s to the present. It provides details about the last battle between the US Cavalry and Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest and follows the lives of the series of inhabitants that occupied an isolated ranch as it developed through trying times that saw it fragment into four individual homesteads, endure the era of the Great Depression, and emerge post WWII reconstituted as one of the first dude ranches in Idaho. Special focus is on land use changes during those times. The story also includes the return of the area to uninhabited wilderness and little known aspects of the events leading up to its inclusion in the present day Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. The account is based on and constrained by unpublished diaries, homestead records, and correspondence of the principal residents of Cabin Creek. To the extent that it follows the occupation of Cabin Creek by Luman Caswell and his brothers, it also provides a sequel to my earlier book Wilderness Brothers. In addition to those who enjoyed Wilderness Brothers: Prospecting, Horse Packing, & Homesteading on the Western Frontier, this book will be of interest to many other readers of western US history, from those with general interest to professional scholars. Illustrated with over 100 photographs, many of them of the Cabin Creek area more than a century ago. A number of the photos illustrate landscape changes between then and now.",2014-02-10,10 February 2014,Cabin Creek; Caswell Brothers; Big Creek,45.130393,-114.940498,,,CabinCreekChronicle,,,,,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,image,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/twrs/CabinCreekChronicle.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/twrs/small/cabincreekchronicle_sm.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/twrs/thumbs/cabincreekchronicle_th.jpg

Using the lining material pattern for dating these gloves were dated to 1880, the year after the Sheepeater Campaign was concluded where he served as a civilian ammunition packer. The bead pattern on these gloves is typical of bead-work done by Shoshone women of that time period. It is not known when Dave Lewis wore these gloves. One possibility was when the U.S. Army moved the small Sheepeater band from Fort Vancouver, Washington to Fort Hall, Idaho Territory in the spring of 1880.

b2-bighornsheep-036,,b2-BighornSheep-036.pdf,"Pattern of Herbivory, Nitrogen Content, and Biomass of Bluebunch Wheatgrass on a Mountain Sheep Habitat in Central Idaho","Peek, James M.","Bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] A. Love) is a major forage species for mountain sheep (Ovis canadensis) in central Idaho. Observed condition of this forage species is high, prompting an investigation of herbivory levels and subsequently nutrient content and biomass of this species. Mean amounts of tissue removed from wheatgrass plants on a slope frequently used by mountain sheep ranged from 5.3% to 26.8% from 1992-1996. Nitrogen levels ranged from 0.7-1.4% from 1998-2007 in plants collected in late June after seed-set. Higher levels of N occurred in growth following wildfire burns. Above-ground growth of bluebunch wheatgrass ranged from 11 .3 to !02.1 gm/m2 and was highly correlated with spring precipitation. While herbivory on this major forage species was low to moderate, nitrogen levels may vary enough to affect mountain sheep population trends without appreciably affecting productivity of their major forage species.",2010,2010,bighorn sheep; ecology; Salmon River Mountains; Bluebunch wheatgrass,,,,,b2-BighornSheep-036,"In Copyright.

b2-bighornsheep-037,,b2-BighornSheep-037.pdf,Spatial Relationships And Behavior Of Bighorn Sheep Sharing A Winter Range With Mule Deer And Elk In Central Idaho,"Akenson, Holly A.","The effects of behavioral interactions on bighorn sheep by mule deer and elk were assessed on a shared winter range. Bighorn sheep, mule deer, and elk were observed on the Cliff creek study area in central Idaho. Behavior, locations, and proximity to the closest herd of another species were determined through scan sampling. Seasonal habitat use was similar among bighorn sheep, mule deer, and elk during winter and spring. Bighorn sheep and mule deer showed a positive association, especially in spring when both species fed together in grasslands. This tendency to be in close proximity to each other probably reflects the lack of competition between these species and may reflect an antipredator advantage of mixed species grouping. Bighorn sheep and elk herds were further from each other than bighorn sheep and mule deer, and were rarely observed in mixed groups. Elk used higher elevations than sheep. Elk and sheep generally had a neutral to negative association. The low use of the study area by elk and infrequent contact between sheep and elk prevented a thorough assessment of this relationship. The one situation in which sheep and elk were consistently observed in mixed groups was when coyotes were present on the study area. Interspecific relationships, both positive associations and competition, appear to explain behaviors and distribution of bighorn sheep, mule deer, and elk on the Cliff Creek study area, but other explanations could not be statistically eliminated. Recent changes in bighorn sheep and elk numbers now provide an opportunity to compare interspecific relationships at 2 population levels to evaluate changes in these ungulate relationships on the Cliff Creek study area.",1992-12,December 1992,bighorn sheep; ecology; habits; mule deer; elk; Cliff Creek,,,,,b2-BighornSheep-037,"In Copyright.

As you travel the 104 miles of the Middle Fork, you will see many cultural values present on the river banks of the Middle Fork. This is the home of the Tuka-Deka Sheep Eaters Native American Tribes. The Tuka-Deka were hunter-gatherer people who lived in the river corridor area until 1879. The Sheep Eater war of 1879 ended the permanent residence of the ancestors to the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, the Tuka-Deka. The Middle Fork of the Salmon has many irreplaceable cultural resources. Many of the sites have house depressions left behind by the Sheep Eater Indian Tribes. Please respect these sites by camping in designated areas. And leave artifacts where you find them. Help us preserve the stories of the past that are all over the river corridor in the form of pictographs by not touching them. As river users, you can be active stewards in protecting the resources for future generations to enjoy as you visit the Middle Fork of the Salmon.

twrs298,,51YtbEArj1L.jpg,Wilderness Brothers,"Minshall, G.W.","The book traces the lives of Luman Caswell, his two brothers Ben and Dan, and their close associates A. O. Huntley and Wesley Ritchey during the time leading up to and following their discovery of gold on Thunder Mountain. It includes a 2500-mile odyssey, by buckboard wagon and horseback, from western Colorado, across Utah and Nevada and into Idaho. Thunder Mountain is located in central Idaho within the present day Frank Church Wilderness. The Thunder Mountain stampede of the early 1900s (which the Caswells triggered) was the last major gold rush in the region. However, the emphasis of this account is on self reliance and day-to-day activities and adventures of the times, rather than on the rush per se. Wilderness Brothers captures the spirit of the times from a different perspective than other books of this genre, to document several poorly-known aspects of the history of the region, and to provide a record of land-use practices prior to designation as “wilderness.”",2012-02-15,15 February 2012,Cabin Creek; Caswell Brothers; Big Creek,45.130393,-114.940498,,,51YtbEArj1L,,,media,,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,image,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/twrs/51YtbEArj1L.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/twrs/small/51ytbearj1l_sm.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/twrs/thumbs/51ytbearj1l_th.jpg
