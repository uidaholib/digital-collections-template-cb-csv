,Interviewer,Please state your name and your title or role at UI.,
,LM,Lynda Freeman and I am the Academic Support Specialist for the WWAMI Medical Education Program and I'm also a clinical faculty member. Clinical Assistant Faculty.,wwami
,IN,"What is your ethnicity or race? Do you identify as African American, African, Caribbean, etc.?",
,LM,I identify as African American.,
,IN,Where are you from?,
,LM,"Atlanta, Georgia.",
,IN,What brought you to UI?,
,LM,"Jobs. So, my husband was applying for faculty positions and I had just finished my Doctorate and UI made him an offer. We sent my CV and ended up getting with WWAMI, so we moved out here.",wwami
,IN,Have you had any previous experiences that you feel prepared you for UI?,
,LM,"Yeah, I went to school at a predominantly white school, probably kindergarten through sixth grade so being around white people wasn't foreign to me. This is probably the whitest space I've ever been in.",
,IN,Was it a tough transition moving to Moscow since it’s predominantly white?,
,LM,Not because it’s the whitest space. It was tough because of the distance from family. My close family. They all still live in Georgia.,family
,IN,Were you nervous to move here or about being here since it’s called the South of the North?,
,LM,"I didn't know that before I got here. I heard about Coeur d’Alene so I didn't want to visit Coeur d'Alene. So that part didn't make me nervous because eventually I ended up going because my husband’s likes going up there and it can be okay. He talked to someone who used to live here who was African American who was like, “Oh yeah, we go there just to get away, you know, and it’s fine.” ",
,LM,"So, I didn't really realize… that’s the first time I had heard that term and yeah. I definitely am aware of my surroundings and protective of my husband. Especially in light of what’s going on across the nation. Knowing that I am in this space and that even though that white supremacist camp is shut down, you know, people don't just disappear into thin air. So, I'm definitely aware of that.",
,IN,Do you feel like you'll stay in this community for a long time? Why or why not?,
,LM,"No, because I'm very close to my family and this distance is very tough and they're not going to move to Idaho. I tried.",family
,IN,"Do you like living here? If they did move to Idaho, would you stay? Would you want them to move here?",
,LM,"I think Moscow is a good place. I don't think anywhere outside of Moscow I'm comfortable. So, even now, the last couple of times we've visited Coeur d’Alene you can feel the, I guess the racial tension. There’s been a shift, especially with the new administration (Trump Presidency). The current president we have, there’s been a shift and it’s not comfortable and it’s not pleasant. I think it’s a beautiful place, but I don't know if long term.",moscow
,IN,Have you built any strong relationships with any other black people or faculty at UI?,
,LM,"Yes, a couple. We're so spread out, there’s not that many. But there are a couple of faculty and staff that I've connected with.",
,IN,Have you had positive experiences related to your race at UI?,
,LM,"Yes. So, I'll use the example of two or three weeks ago, I gave a lecture about my culture in an anthropology class. That was a great opportunity to share with people about who I am and students submitted questions they would like answered.",students
,IN,Did you get any good ones?,
,LM,"Yeah, I think one of the best ones was What is your opinion on the national anthem. So that one really made me think and do my research and I present just like the facts. So, I was like yeah I used to love my national anthem. And then this happened with Colin Kaepernick and so that made me look at it. So, I heard something about the third verse referring to slaves, is that true. And I pulled up the lyrics and yeah, it is true. Then people are like they weren't talking about African American slaves, this an argument. Like okay. Even if it that is true, the person that wrote this song was a slave owner who built his wealth on the backs of slaves.",
,LM," So when he wrote “The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave”, I don’t think he was talking about me. Just being able to explain that and to probably students that hadn’t heard that before. So, it’s been a great experience. Some people are aware of the climate we live in and they do check in, just to you know, when they see racist things happen, they ask like, “Hey, are you okay? I know this is probably affecting you.” There’s probably one or two people on campus that do that regularly. So I appreciate that.",students
,IN,Have you had negative experiences related to your race at UI?,
,LM,"There was… you know the Commons where you're not supposed to go all the way down? You're not supposed to park there, but I was picking up my husband one night from the Commons. There was a line of cars there, so I just went and parked there. And actually, I didn't see that you weren't supposed to drive down there. We had only been here a few months, maybe, but anyway. So, there’s a police car and they were coming up while I was parked. They passed all these cars, then the police officer looked over and saw me, made a U-turn, pulled behind me, turned the lights on, everything.",
,IN,Are there people in all the other cars?,
,LM,"Yeah, a row of white people in parked cars. They get to my car, make a U-turn, and literally did the whole deal. This is the first time I've ever been stopped, like ever. I've gotten parking tickets before and that kind of thing, but this is the first kind of thing where I'm like moving like okay. So, the officer gets out of the car and tells me that I'm not supposed to be parked here. And I was like I didn't realize that, because I really didn't see the sign. And he was oh you didn't, and I was yeah, I didn’t. Then they proceeded to ask for my license and registration, so I went to the mode that if okay if something pops off, I'll deal with it in court, like get me home safe, that’s my whole thing.",
,LM," So, I told him, “I’m faculty here and my husband is faculty. I’m just waiting to pick him up.” And the officer is like very dismissive. I showed him my UI ID that said faculty on it, and they were like I don’t need that. Then they took my license and registration and ran it. When they came back, they were like, “You know, you’re not supposed to park here.” They were nice. It was almost like they were waiting to find something, they thought they were going to find something, but I have a clean record. But it was just so blatant. They let me go with a warning, whatever. And then there was a car, so I went down and turned around, so as I was turning around there was another car that came and parked and the same officer just asked the person to roll down their window and told them, “You know, you can’t park here,” and then let them go. So that’s a nice example.",faculty
,IN,Have you noticed any differences in people’s treatment of you since Donald Trump has been in office?,
,LM,"Yes. So, going back to the Coeur d’Alene example more stares and they're not friendly. So, there’s a difference between curious and… So, I'm used to being like the only chocolate drop in the room so people are going to look, right? But then there is a look where it’s not a friendly or curious or kind look either. So, you can feel, you can literally feel the difference. So, yeah, I've noticed that. Even, it’s probably been a month ago, I went to WinCo one evening and there’s someone wearing a confederate flag hoodie. The whole hoodie was a confederate flag. And I was like, “Okay, I just want to get to my car.” As I was walking out this white lady walked by the guy and said really loudly, “Oh, I love your hoodie.” Just kind of like, rubbed it in. I think people feel more comfortable now, doing that kind of thing.",
,IN,What do feel you have contributed to your department at UI?,
,LM,"So, my role is new to this department. It’s new, so I think I've added in that way. Another way I've added, because of being the only person of color I think in this office I have a chance to provide— I'm asked to provide input on topics related to diversity or cultural sensitivity. And work without students who maybe are under represented ethnically. And serve as what they call a Champion. So students who may have issues or experience discrimination, they have an outlet to voice those concerns and I try to advocate for them in that way. I guess that’s something new to my department and it’s a role that I embrace.",race;students;diversity
,LM," It’s not one that I was looking to take on, but when you are a minority people look to you as the… but I’m not an expert. There are people that train and go to school, I just happen to be black. I think overall it’s been good. If it’s too much I just step back, like it’s just too much. So I think I’ve contributed in that way and just provide an honest voice like yeah, this is racist or this could be perceived racist. Or you may need to look at how we approach this.",
,IN,Some of the other people I've interviewed have expressed an annoyance or frustration at having to be the representative or guide to white people to teach them what it good and what is bad when they should just figure it out.,
,LM,"Yes and no. So I feel like if you're sincere and want to learn  I don't mind sharing. At the same time there’s plenty of books and literature and if you're concerned and want to know there’s resources there for you to read. So, there’s a course that I lead and one of the sessions we had was on white fragility. That was really interesting. So you have students who were like, “Man.” They read the articles and were like, “I didn't like this,” but then it’s like, “Oh, I'm acting that way.”",students
,LM," It’s interesting, but then you have other people commenting, this could be faculty too, that are like, “Cultural appropriation, people are mad because we eat pizza and that cultural…” you and they kind of minimize, minimalized it. You could see they center themselves, so you’re acting out exactly what we’re talking about. I’m not going to make you feel less guilty, but I think my personality is the type that I don’t want you to feel bad, but at the same time I want to be honest.",faculty
,IN,"Kind of like I don't want you to feel bad, but at the same time your behavior is problematic.",
,LM,"I think, again I don't mind sharing and teaching, but it’s the people that are willing to. Even here, I've had to tell people, “Hey, don't touch my hair. I don't like it when you touch my hair.” It seems like common sense. Some people would think that, but some people feel comfortable doing that. But don't do that. And they don't even think about, but if it was the reverse and I came and start stroking your hair, you're going to be like what are you doing. So, there’s teaching moments I guess. There are teaching moments when I don't want to teach. I don’t. I shouldn't have to spend my time and energy, in addition to my regular job, to deal with this.",
,IN,A few of the other people I've interviewed have mentioned something about their colleagues saying they're colorblind and don't see race.,
,LM,"I've been told that I'm colorblind and I'm like, “Well, hmm, I'm black so.” It’s like saying you don't see that part of me and that’s a big part of me, of my identity. So, I've heard that and I think, I don’t know. People are, I think some people are just ignorant. I've heard comments about me that I know if it was a white man or a white woman it wouldn't have been said. I mean that’s here in the department. It’s interesting being black and navigating an extremely white space with people who haven't interacted with black people or people of color on a regular basis.",
