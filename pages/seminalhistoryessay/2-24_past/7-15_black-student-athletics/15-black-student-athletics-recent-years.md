### _Black Student Athletics: Recent Years_ ###

In recent years there have been many Black student-athletes at the University of Idaho who have made significant strides in their athletic performance. Dr. Veneice Guillory played for the Vandal’s basketball team during the 2001-2002 season. Though she played only one season before injuring herself, her academic and professional interests  led her to earn a PhD in cultural studies and social thought in education from Washington State University. She now works as an associate professor at San Jose State University in San Jose California.[^80] In 2022, Gevani McCoy, the Vandals football team’s quarterback, was awarded the Jerry Rice Award for the best freshman of the year.[^81] There are several other Black student-athletes at the University that, just as those before them, are continuing to set records and achievements at the University of Idaho.
