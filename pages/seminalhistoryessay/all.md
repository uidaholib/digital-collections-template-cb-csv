# Introduction #

The University of Idaho, founded in 1889, has had its fair share of history and relevance in the state of Idaho.  The University of Idaho has championed itself as one of the best and most affordable colleges in the United States, ranking 28th in Best Value and 179th in Best National Universities.[^1] These achievements highlight a perceived attitude that individuals closely associated with the University (from its founding) wish to see it become one of the highest-ranked schools in the United States. However, it is clear that the University of Idaho is not one of the country’s most racially and ethnically diverse institutions. As of the writing of this document (2023), the following statistics provide a demographic of the state of the University of Idaho.

The University of Idaho is ranked 2,657 out of 3,790 out of all universities in the United States (or a diversity score of 29.90/100), with just 16% of the school’s total population being comprised of ethnic minorities as well as having an overall low Black faculty ethnic diversity.[^2] Looking closer at the University’s population, a majority of students of color identify as Hispanic or Latino (~10%), International (~6%), Two or More Races (~3%), Asian (~2%), Native American/Native Alaskan (~1%), and Black/African American (~1.2%).[^3] These numbers highlight a predominantly White university, making it understandable to assume that the University is one where students of color have not had a significant presence. 

However, these assumptions are far from the truth for the University of Idaho, which has had a significant history with its students of color and faculty members, especially those of the Black or African-American community. As a note for the reader, when dealing with the terms Black and African-American, Black will denote all collective history of African-Americans and Africans at universities, while African-American will denote history in relation to those who are descendants of slaves.

# Past (1895-1999) #

The 19th century was a time of much migration towards the West, either by forced relocation or the hope of “greener pastures.” This massive movement of people to the West brought a generalized effort on the part of the US government in establishing a foothold. With much of the western lands having been bought by the United States under the Louisiana Purchase of 1803[^4] and the territorial acquisitions made as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo following the Mexican-American War,[^5] the US government sought to exploit their new territory. As such, the movements of people began, but in these early years of settlement, most of these peoples moving west were those who had been forced from their homes. One such notable forced relocation was that of Native American tribes (along with the forcible expansion of slavery westward under the international slave trade), which had called the southern and southeastern United States their ancestral homes under the Indian Removal Act of 1830; the removal of these tribes was later referred to as the Trail of Tears.[^6]  

Though the tribes (Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole) relocated  only as far as Oklahoma, they were some of the first peoples to move into the newly acquired territories. The next movement of people in 1848 had begun settling the West because of the California Gold Rush.[^7]  This was before the Compromise of 1850, which had granted California statehood (in 1850) and established the territories of Oregon and Utah.  The major motions of colonization, however, would not occur until the passing of the Homestead Act in 1862[^8] and the end of the Civil War in 1865. Many settlers found themselves moving west, including a large number of Black settlers establishing large communities in areas like Kansas, with as many as 27,000 settling the area between 1869 and 1879.[^9]

The settling of Idaho also began at this time, with the first permanent settlements established in the early 1860s for the purposes of mining silver and gold.[^10] With these mining communities also came the army, which established several forts and found itself in constant conflict with the tribes in the area. This eventually led to the Nez Perce War of 1877, which saw the native Nez Perce Tribe removed from their lands that would eventually serve as the grounds for the establishment of the town of Moscow. 

Settled in 1871, before the removal of the Nez Perce Tribe, the community of Moscow grew after the Nez Perce War of 1877, eventually establishing itself as an independent town in 1885.[^11] This was shortly followed by the town being chosen as the site for a new land-grant institution, the University of Idaho, in 1889. Just a year later, in 1890, the town of Moscow would find itself part of the new state of Idaho.[^12] The introduction of the University of Idaho in Moscow, and its newfound position in a state (rather than a territory), aided in attracting more people to the town.

The Black/African-American community at the University of Idaho has had a storied history in the area. **Starting from its founding, the school has had a continuous Black student population that has collectively made an impact on the University.** Since the 1960s, the Black student population has pushed for their own organizations to fuel inclusivity at the University, they have pushed for new classes to discuss Black history, and they have pushed to have a stronger voice on campus.  The effort from Black students at the University of Idaho mirrors similar movements  for recognition from other universities across the United States and exemplifies a desire for inclusivity and the breaking down of tone-deaf university culture that has blocked Black students and faculty from excelling in their fields. This push has changed the culture of universities in the United States and has certainly made higher education an easier field to navigate for Black students and faculty, though many issues still persist. 

## _The First Black Graduates of UI: Jennie Eva Hughes_ ##

Starting at the beginning, the University of Idaho was founded in 1889 by Governor Stevenson when he signed the Territorial Legislature's Council Bill No. 20.[^13] The first graduating class of the University was 1896, which saw a total of four graduates: two White men and two White women. This graduating class is not unusual for the time in the Northwest United States, especially before the First and Second Great Migrations in the 20th century; however, the enrollment during the 1895-1896 school year was peculiar. 

Jennie Eva Hughes was the first Black/African-American student to enroll at the University of Idaho in 1895 after graduating from Moscow High School on April 26, 1895.[^14] Though not much is known about her father, Alexander Hughes, it is known that her mother, Louisa, and her stepfather, Lewis E. Crisemon, were soon married after Jennie Eva Hughes’s birth. The Crisemon family moved west, first stopping in Pennsylvania, where Louisa had their first child, Gertrude. Eventually, the family resettled in Moscow, Idaho, during the 1890s, joining the 201 Black/African-American families in Idaho and becoming the only Black/African-American family in Moscow.[^15]  

The Crisemon family became quite reputable within Moscow. Hughes’s father likely became a successful businessman of either a restaurant or barbershop (those were the only two professions open to Blacks/African-Americans at the time),[^16] and her mother worked as a houseworker in the Moscow area as evidenced by Jennie Eva Hughes’s 1898 registration card.[^17]

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ma2000_29_001" %}

This apparent ease of the Crisemon family to blend in with the town of Moscow does suggest that the small town may not have been as racially barring toward the small migration of Black people as other western towns at the time. This certainly would have made life easier for the Crisemons in the Moscow area; however, recent work concerning Moscow history in the early 20th century somewhat damages that perspective. 

In an article published by NPR, James Lowen (a sociologist and historian) discussed his research into sundown towns across the United States and **notes that Moscow was one such town**.[^18] Somewhere between 1904 and 1909, the Chinese population of Moscow was driven out of the town by “cowboys,” which certainly highlights a racist attitude towards the town’s non-white inhabitants.[^19] While this took place after the Hughes family settled in Moscow, it is an essential element to remember as the town would not have developed this line of thought overnight. This information certainly makes Jennie Eva Hughes’s story all the more impressive, as she not only settled in the area, but also attended the University of Idaho and obtained her bachelor’s degree. 

Looking at Hughes’s academic career in Moscow and at the University of Idaho, she was an excellent student who excelled in her studies. She is noted as having “…accumulated an admirable academic record”[^20] and certainly showed her excellence within the classroom. In 1898, she won the Watkins Medal for Oratory with her speech “The Uncrowned King,” which received significant recognition from both the judges and the general public.[^21]  The judges delivered their highest commendations towards Hughes, stating that

> *Miss Hughes is a member of the junior class, an excellent student, and the only colored student in the institution. Her oration was well-written and her delivery excellent. The contest was the best thus far in the history of the university, and reflected high honor on all the participants.* [^22]

This opinion held by the judges is interesting, especially in a competition hosted by and competed in with an overwhelmingly White assembly. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="mg5758_003;mg5758_004" %}

Similar reactions were had within the _Argonaut_, the University of Idaho’s own student-run newspaper, which commended Hughes again in their June 1st edition of 1899 saying, “Miss Hughes had proven herself a competent orator prior to class day, having won the Watkins’ Medal, but she captivated everyone Tuesday with her excellently delivered oration.”[^23] The number of commendations and amount of respect that Hughes received from both the student body and the faculty shows that she was held in high esteem amongst her peers. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg-1899-06-01_p181-innovation" %}

In 1899, she would graduate with her Bachelor of Science degree, giving a speech to her class to “occupy positions of usefulness.”[^24] Jennie Eva Hughes eventually married George Augustus Smith in 1899 and grew a family in the North Idaho area where they also owned several properties. However, Hughes and her family would eventually move to the Spokane area due to Hughes finding the primarily White mining towns of North Idaho to be unsafe for her children. Though no record of any particular incidents are mentioned, this is another signal that the area may have been racially hostile in the early 20th century.[^25] Despite this, Hughes’s son Berthol returned to the area to attend the University of Idaho as its third Black/African-American student, though he tragically died in 1919 before he graduated. 

## _The First Black Graduates of UI: Edna Gertrude Chrisman_ ##

While researching further the history of early Black students at the University of Idaho, it was found that there was another Black student who attended before Berthol, who was originally believed to have been the University’s second Black student. This second student at the University of Idaho was **Jennie Eva Hughes’ sister, Edna Gertrude Chrisman**, indicating that the University of Idaho and the Hughes family had a strong connection. 

Chrisman enrolled at the University of Idaho’s preparatory school in 1903, with an image of her in the Mandolin Club[^26] and her name listed in the _University Bulletin_ as a second year student.[^27] Most of Chrisman’s recorded history at the University is centered around her time at the preparatory school, as she only attended her freshman year.[^28] She left the University of Idaho in 1908 and enrolled at the University of Puget Sound, graduating in 1910 with her bachelor’s degree.[^29]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="gem_1903_gertrudechrisman_02" %}

An interesting discovery regarding Chrisman was the procurement of 160 acres of land from a Coeur d’Alene/Spokane Indian River drawing in 1910.[^30] With this procurement, Chrisman spent two years homesteading the land before selling it and moving to the Los Angeles area with her family, where she purchased an apartment building and went back to school.[^31] She enrolled at the State Normal School in Los Angeles,[^32] where she joined the Pi Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority and eventually graduated with her teaching degree in 1916.[^33] From there, she taught at Booker T. Washington school in El Centro, Imperial Valley, California, and eventually became the principal of the school.[^34] She later died on May 28, 1966, in Los Angeles.  

### _Summary_ ###

The Hughes's family story is important to the University of Idaho and the Moscow area not only because they were the first Black/African-American students to both attend and graduate from the University, but because they were also able to excel in the Moscow area. While most towns in the developing West were certainly racially barring, the town of Moscow in the late 19th and early 20th centuries seems to have been welcoming to the Crisemon (also Hughes or Chrisman) family. Their success in integrating to the area, over that of Chinese settlers in the early 20th century, may be contributed to the unusualness of Black people in the area or the relatively small migration when compared to the much larger migration of the Chinese. In other words, it may be that the Crisemon family found more of a welcoming attitude as their arrival did not upset the overall racial makeup of Moscow, whereas the Chinese migration did. The Crisemon story also shows that Black/African-American academics would be taken seriously in the area, and that they would be allowed to obtain degrees from the University of Idaho.

## _1920 to the 1950s: The Quiet/Unknown Years_ ##

From the point of Berthol’s death in 1919 to approximately the early 1950s, it seems that either there was not a substantial Black student population on campus, or Black students during this period were not as widely active as later student populations; there is little recorded documentation of their involvement. These years were also quite a turbulent time for the state of Idaho, with many issues arising that stressed the state. 

One of the first issues was that of the Depression of 1920, where the newly expanded mining, lumber, and agriculture industries (due to the need for material goods in World War I) saw prices for goods drop noticeably low. After the Depression of 1920, Idaho’s economy never recovered, but instead remained stagnant at lower levels until the Great Depression of the 1930s, which caused significant economic downturns for the state. This can be seen in the economic prices of raw materials between 1929 and 1933, with Idaho’s famous white pine dropping 269 million board feet (unit of volume for timber equal to 144 cubic inches), the selling price of wheat bushels from a $1.30 to $0.26, and the production of mined goods dropping from over $32 million to under $10 million.[^35] Furthermore, the average income of Idaho residents dropped by around 55%. During this time, Idaho remained one of the most underdeveloped states in the Pacific Northwest.[^36]  

Though the state of Idaho would finally start to see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the Great Depression, it would again be thrust into a chaotic climate with the outbreak of World War II. The outbreak of World War II in Idaho was met in two distinctive ways. The first was with patriotic fervor, and the second was a deep racial mistrust of Japanese-Americans living in the area. 

Looking first at the patriotic fervor of Idaho, many went off to fight in the war, with the University of Idaho serving as a collection post. As part of the Morrill Act Obligation, the act that gave land to academic institutions,[^37] the University of Idaho had conducted military training since its founding.[^38] The University had also maintained such programs as the Naval ROTC and radio training, and as such, the University of Idaho served much like a military installation during World War II. The main focus of most individuals at the time was undoubtedly aiding in the war effort, which is further seen in the scrap drives organized  and the honorary parades held in Moscow at the time. With such effort put into military initiatives, it is unlikely that the University was pursuant in student recruitment, though as can be seen with some (like Reginald Reeves, who we will discuss shortly), it is possible that there were Black students at the University who came to be there through wartime participation.

Race shaped the experience of the home front in Idaho, which was home to Japanese internment camps. With the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Empire, President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented one of the most infamous species of legislation in American history, Executive Order 9066, which saw to the removal of Japanese Americans from their homes to internment camps in the West.[^39] There were two internment camps located in Idaho during the war, with the first called the “Kooskia Internment Camp” and located 30 miles from Kooskia, Idaho, around two and a half hours from Moscow. A total of around 265 Japanese men were incarcerated at this camp between 1943 and 1945.[^40]  The second camp was called the “Minidoka War Relocation Center,” which was located just outside Jerome, Idaho, around seven and a half hours from Moscow. This camp saw around 13,000 people of Japanese ancestry behind its barbed fences between August of 1942 and October of 1945.[^41]   	

During this time period, from 1920 to the 1950s, heightened and fueled racial tensions within a predominantly White Idaho would have certainly played a role in the University of Idaho’s ability to diversify. As such, a small Black student population would make sense.  Even after the end of the war and the closing of the internment camps, the overall Black population of North Idaho remained quite small. In the 1960 US Census, Latah county reported having a total population of 21,170 but only reported having 130 Black/African-American inhabitants.[^42] This number, in comparison to other western towns during the migration up to the 1960s, was in line with similar numbers being reported during the time, with California noting the biggest growth of a Black population during the time, and Idaho, with Montana and Wyoming, reporting one of the smallest growths in the area.[^43]

## _Black Student Athletics_ ##

Most of the recorded documentation that is accessible from the University of Idaho in regards to Black students is from the athletics program, where many Black students attending the school were student-athletes. This seems to have been a strong reason for the University to recruit Black students in the 1960s and 1970s, as most of the Black students who were admitted were student-athletes. There also exists the notion that Black student-athletes are/were recruited to first generate revenue for their institution and, second, to participate as students. It is also important to note that this timeline coincides with the heightened activity of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, which pushed for greater inclusion of Blacks/African-Americans in tertiary education. With these two factors applied to the context of Black student recruitment at the University of Idaho, it becomes necessary to understand that pressure on the University and an expansion in the athletics program is what fueled the recruitment of Black student-athletes. And, as a precursor to relevant information later in the document, Black student-athletes were the main driving force behind inclusivity in general at universities across the United States, which played a role in the University of Idaho’s Black history. 

The University of Idaho’s athletics program has had many successful athletes come through its doors, with several of them being Black. Though there have been many contributions made by Black Athletes at the University of Idaho, the athletes listed below have left a more notable imprint at UI, with their names included in the Vandals Hall of Fame. 

### _Black Student Athletics: Whaylon Coleman_ ###

Though most of the star Black student-athletes that played for the University of Idaho signed on after 1960, there was an **exception in basketball player Whaylon Coleman**. Coleman was originally from Kentucky, where he attended Dunbar elementary school and Western High School before pursuing his degree in higher education.[^44] He enrolled at the University in 1955 and played for the Vandals basketball team through the 1959 season. As a junior, he led the Vandals to a 17-9 record and also helped in securing a fourth-place finish in the Pacific Coast Conference, with victories over University of Southern California, Stanford, University of California at Los Angeles, University of California at Berkeley and University of Oregon, and rival Washington State University . 

During that season, Coleman ranked second on the team in scoring and led the team with a .424 field goal percentage (72 out of 170 shots made). His teammates honored him at the end of the season by nominating him as the Jay Gano Award winner, which is the award given to the player voted most inspirational by the team. During his senior year in 1958-59, Coleman led the Vandal men with a 12.3 points-per-game scoring average, or with his 319 points scored in 26 games. He also led the team with a .431 field goal percentage and a .724 free throw percentage. During his entire Vandals career, he scored 806 points.[^45]  

After graduating from the University of Idaho with his bachelor’s degree, Coleman enrolled at Western Kentucky University and obtained his master’s degree in education in 1971 and his Rank 1 certificate in secondary school administration in 1973.[^46]  During his life, he received many awards and recognitions, including being the first African-American captain of a University of Idaho Vandals varsity sports team; he was also handpicked by the coaches of other teams for the Basketball All-Conference Second Team for his outstanding play. 

Coleman was inducted into the University of Idaho Hall of Fame and into the Idaho Legends Hall of Fame; he also received the Golden Apple Award from the Owensboro Board of Education and the Owensboro High School Hall of Achievement. After working for the Owensboro Riverport Authority’s board of directors for 33 years, the Green River Steel property was renamed the Whaylon Coleman Terminal. Coleman unfortunately passed away in 2012, leaving behind a notable legacy in Idaho athletics and the Owensboro community. 

### _Black Student Athletics: Gus “Honeycomb” Johnson_ ###

Another of these great student-athletes was Gus “Honeycomb” Johnson, who, while only playing one season with the Vandals basketball team, quickly became a legend in Vandals history. Gus Johnson was born and raised in Akron, Ohio (Lebron James’ hometown), and would eventually join the Amateur Athletic Union Club until he accepted a scholarship offer to play a year at Boise Junior College (Boise State University). During his career there, he averaged 30 points and 20 rebounds per game until he transferred further north to the University of Idaho in 1962.[^47] During his one season with the Vandals, in 1963, he averaged 19 points and 20.3 rebounds per game and led the Vandals to a 20-6 season. His 20.3 rebounds average in 1963 ranked second in the NCAA, and his 466 rebounds in the 1963 season remains the current record at the University of Idaho.[^48] It is no surprise that he was drafted 10th overall (second round) by the Baltimore Billets (later the Washington Wizards) and led a prestigious career in the NBA for 11 years. 

During his Johnson played for the Baltimore Billets, the Phoenix Suns, and the Indiana Pacers; he appeared in five NBA All-Star games, and in 1973 (his final year), he won with the Pacers in the American Basketball Association (ABA) Finals championship game. Johnson’s legacy as one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history has been cemented by his recognition from previous teams, with his induction into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame[^49] and the University of Idaho Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007,[^50] and into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.[^51] Even though his time at the University of Idaho was short, his success and excellence on the Vandals team stood out and garnered him widespread recognition. 

### _Black Student Athletics: Ray “Thunder Ray” McDonald_ ###

{% include feature/image.html objectid="athleticspromo_rayheismanpose" %}

Ray “Thunder Ray'' McDonald was one of the greatest football players to play for the Vandals football team during the 1965 and 1966 seasons, as well as an exceptional competitor in the Vandals Track and Field team. Originally from the McKinley suburb in Texas, one of the largest segregated Black/African-American suburbs in Texas at the time, he had moved to Caldwell, Idaho, during his junior year of high school. While attending Caldwell High School, he became a three-sport star in football, basketball, and track and field while also being the only Black athlete on the school’s sports teams.[^52] While there, he also found a passion for music and piano, even participating in the high school choir. 

McDonald enrolled at the University of Idaho in 1963, starting on the freshman football team and having a successful football year. His sophomore year was as successful as his freshman year, even though he suffered an Achilles tendon tear and missed his first three games (an injury he would deal with for the rest of his professional football career). 

He rose to fame during the 1965 and 1966 football years, where he was named an All-American and set several records at the University of Idaho that still stand to this day. McDonald holds the most rushing yards per game at the University of Idaho, sitting at 132.9 yards per game, and lies fourth in the state of Idaho when it comes to most yards in one game (255 yards).[^53]  

While he was at the University of Idaho, it seems that the town of Moscow and the University of Idaho was quite accepting of McDonald according to some of his teammates.[^54] He was eventually drafted 13th overall by the Washington Redskins in the 1967 NFL draft, though his professional career was not as notable as his collegiate career had been. During his 1967 to 1969 professional football career, he saw little play with the Redskins as his injury caught up with him and he was publicly outed as being gay. 

All-in-all, McDonald’s professional football career was over, and he instead moved to Washington D.C. where he finished his studies in music and taught at the Patricia Roberts Harris Educational Center.[^55] Inducted into the University of Idaho Hall of Fame, his legacy at the University has certainly inspired many other Black student-athletes to rise to the occasion. These Black student-athletes were not only great athletes, but also role models for Black students looking to have collegiate careers in Northern Idaho; their success also benefitted the University of Idaho, which saw significant importance in recruiting outside of the local pool.

### _Black Student Athletics: Robert Pipkin_ ###

Another great Black athlete who went on to do great things outside of his collegiate basketball career was Robert (or Bob) Pipkin. Pipkin had come to renown while playing for the Aliquippa High School in Pennsylvania, where he was a two-time Section All-Star and named a preseason All-American in his senior year in 1963. After high school, he attended Dodge City Community College, where he led the team to a 60-4 record and was named a Junior College All-American.[^56] After his time at Dodge City Community College, he enrolled at the University of Idaho in 1965 and continued his excellent collegiate career. During the 1966 and 1967 seasons, he was named to the Big Sky Conference Team, was named the Big Sky MVP in the 1966 University of Idaho-Gonzaga game, and was named the Big Sky Conference All-Star.[^57]  

Pipkin would graduate from the University of Idaho in 1971 with his Bachelor of Arts degree, after taking a break for two and a half years for military service and professional basketball tryouts for Kirchein Tech in Germany. His collegiate and professional basketball careers saw him unsurprisingly inducted into the Aliquippa Hall of Fame in 1978 and the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame in 2016.[^58] Pipkin’s basketball career was certainly notable and earned him a great deal of recognition, but his professional career outside of basketball also saw many commendations.

After the University of Idaho, Pipkin would enroll and graduate from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with his Master of Science in Education degree and principal certification.  He would also complete his course work for his PhD in the same field. He then **went into the Pittsburgh Public School District** for 53 years to better promote the needs of Black students in the city and to further shrink the gap between the White and Black communities.[^59] He served many different roles in the system, including Principal of Prospect Middle School Center for Multi-Racial, Multi-Ethnic, and Multicultural Education, to give the Black community living there a better chance to succeed. 

During the 1990s, when Pipkin was doing a majority of his work, Pittsburgh was in an economic downturn with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, but the gap between White unemployment and poverty compared to that of the Black community was notable. Black poverty in Pittsburgh was reported as four times higher than that of White families who lived there.[^60] Due to the high amount of racial inequality and tensions in Pittsburgh at the time, Pipkin and his wife Yvonne founded the North Hills NAACP charter, where Pipkin served as its president for 14 years. He later retired, and the charter was unfortunately closed as no one stepped up to take the mantle of responsibility from him.[^61]  

Pipkin has had a substantial impact on the Black community and as such has received many awards; he was a recipient of the Greater Pittsburgh YWCA’s Racial Justice Award, was named to _Talk Magazine’s_ 50 Most Influential African Americans in Pittsburgh, and was one of 300 board members from the PTA invited to the White House in 2012. Robert Pipkin’s life is another great story of a Black athlete who spent time at the University of Idaho and had a significant impact on the Black community around them as well as those of their White peers.

### _Black Student Athletics: Willette White_ ###

Another inspirational Black student-athlete from the University of Idaho is Willette White, who played for the Vandals women’s basketball team from 1979 to 1981. During her collegiate career at the University of Idaho, she averaged 11.5 points per game and had 169 steals and 356 assists, leading the Vandals women's team to their 64-22 record. She also helped lead the team to back-to-back NCWSA Division II Northwest Region titles in 1980 and 1981, as well as qualifying for the AIAW Division II national tournament both years. She was a two-time AIAW All-Region Team honoree and a Second Team AIAW All-American in 1981.[^62]  

After her time at the University of Idaho, Willette White served as a graduate assistant coach for the women’s basketball team at the Ohio State University from 1982 to 1984, and as a single-year assistant coach at Iowa State. Since 1986, she has been an assistant coach in the highly successful women’s program at the University of Washington.[^63] She was elected into the Northwest Athletic Association of Community Colleges’ Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Vandals Hall of Fame in 2008.[^64] 

### _Black Student Athletics: Angela Whyte_ ###

The University of Idaho has seen many athletes, even Olympic ones such as Angela Whyte, who ran for the Vandals track and field team. Originally from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Whyte was born on May 22, 1980, to Evert Whyte and Gail Dick. Initially enrolling at the University of New Mexico in 1999 and 2000, where she set several records that still stand, she would transfer to the University of Idaho after the 2000 season.[^65]  

Attending the University of Idaho from 2001 to 2003, Whyte went about setting several records and leading the Vandals women’s track and field team to the Big West Championships. The track and field team would win the Big West title, and Whyte would be nominated the Big West Women’s Athlete of the Year. That same year, she would also earn All-America honors at the 2001 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field championships with a third place finish in the 100 meter hurdles, a placement that would see the Vandals track and field team place 16th in the NCAA team standings, which stands as the highest all-time NCAA team finish for the Vandals women’s track and field team.

In 2003, Whyte would again lead the Vandals women’s track and field team to the Big West Conference, with her performance again getting her nominated as the Big West Women’s Athlete of the Year. That same year, Whyte would also break the Big West Conference all-time record and the Big West Championship meet record.[^66] She would earn a further three All-America honors in 2003: one at the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships and two more at the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships. 

Graduating with her bachelor’s degree in crime and justice studies in 2003, she returned to Canada and pursued a professional career in track and field, participating in the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domino, Dominican Republic, and the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Though she did not win medals at these games, she would earn both a silver and a bronze in the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in 2006 and at the Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2007. She would continue to participate in Olympic competitions, representing the Canadian Olympic Team in Beijing (2008) and Rio de Janeiro (2016).[^67]

Outside of her professional career in track and field, Whyte returned to the University of Idaho, where she earned her master’s degree in 2014 and coached for the Vandals track and field team for six years.[^68] In 2015, she would join the Washington State University track and field coaching staff and serve as assistant coach for hurdles, sprints, and jumps. She was inducted into the Vandals Hall of Fame in 2010[^69] and still holds ten of her individual records at the University of Idaho.[^70]  

### _Black Student Athletics: Dan O’Brien_ ###

Another Black student-athlete, who identifies as bi-racial, that passed through the halls of the University of Idaho and later rose to the Olympic podium was Dan O’Brien. Dan O’Brien was born on July 18, 1966, in Portland, Oregon, and grew up in Klamath Falls, Oregon.[^71] He is of African-American and Finnish descent, but was adopted and raised in an Irish-American home. He attended Henley High School in Klamath Falls, Oregon, and in the Oregon State High School Championships led his team to a runner-up finish in which he earned four gold medals for the 110-meter high hurdles, the 300-meter hurdles, the long jump, and the 100-yard dash. 

After graduating from high school, O’Brien initially enrolled at the University of Idaho , but eventually left the University and instead completed his Associate of Arts degree at Spokane Community College. Despite this, he would return to the University of Idaho to complete his bachelor’s degree and join the Vandals track-and-field team in 1988 and 1989. While at the University of Idaho, O’Brien showed his prowess when he earned All-America honors in the 55-meter hurdles with a seventh-place finish at the NCAA Indoor Championships. He also scored a school record and a Big Sky record of 7,988 points in the decathlon, earning him the Big Sky Track and Field Athlete of the Year honors.[^72] From this achievement in his collegiate career, O’Brien would take the next step to becoming an athlete of world-renown. 

In 1988, O’Brien competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials, but due to an injury during his long jump attempt, he had to withdraw.[^73] Despite this, O’Brien participated in the Goodwill games in 1990 and came up second behind Dave Johnson.[^74] In 1991, he traveled to the Tokyo World Championships and took first in the decathlon, earning a gold medal, and afterward entered the 1992 US Olympic Trials. 

He entered the 1992 trials being proclaimed as the “World’s Greatest Athlete” and as the crowd favorite to win the gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics; however, he failed to clear the pole vault and did not make the team.[^75] Regardless of this, O’Brien would later participate in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996,[^76] winning the gold medal with 8,824 points. He would also win the Goodwill Games title in 1998 and solidify his professional career. But after these last two wins, he would not participate in the Olympics again as injuries prevented his return. Despite that, he was still honored by both halls of fame and universities for his achievements. 

After O’Brien’s gold medal win at the 1996 Olympics, he was honored with “Dan O’Brien Day” by the state of Idaho and a parade was held for him in Moscow, Idaho.[^77] He has since been inducted into four halls of fame: the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2005, the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2006, the University of Idaho Sports Hall of Fame in 2007, and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2012.[^78]  

His significance at the University of Idaho was further cemented when the outdoor track and field complex was named after him, and after its renovation in 2012, he was there to rededicate it.[^79] It is clear that, even though he did not spend much time at the University, he played a significant role in the development of University athletics policy, though he may not have had similar experiences to those who were not biracial and instead identified as Black. 

### _Black Student Athletics: Recent Years_ ###

In recent years there have been many Black student-athletes at the University of Idaho who have made significant strides in their athletic performance. Dr. Veneice Guillory played for the Vandal’s basketball team during the 2001-2002 season. Though she played only one season before injuring herself, her academic and professional interests  led her to earn a PhD in cultural studies and social thought in education from Washington State University. She now works as an associate professor at San Jose State University in San Jose California.[^80] In 2022, Gevani McCoy, the Vandals football team’s quarterback, was awarded the Jerry Rice Award for the best freshman of the year.[^81] There are several other Black student-athletes at the University that, just as those before them, are continuing to set records and achievements at the University of Idaho.

## _Blacks in Legal Studies and Military Service: Reginald Reeves_ ##

Reginald Reeves, originally from Greensboro, Carolina, found his way across the country through his participation in the army. He joined the army at the early age of 17 during World War II, eventually finding himself a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Reserves and a platoon leader in the 382nd infantry regiment. Reeves made valuable use of his time in the army before graduating from the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College (a Historically Black College) and receiving his bachelor's degree in mathematics with honors.[^82]  

Arriving at the University of Idaho in the fall of 1949, Reeves found himself as the only Black student enrolled in the College of Law. During his time at the University, Reeves noted (later in life) that he was never approached by any legal fraternities looking for him to join and he also noted a subtle opinion from White faculty/staff members that he was unwanted at the University.[^83]

Despite these feelings, Reeves certainly shined during his time at the University of Idaho, especially with his volunteering for and organizing the University’s first ever blood drive. In 1950, in the midst of the Korean War and with many soldiers in dire need of blood, General Omar Bradley had pleaded with the American people for blood donations. This blood drive spread across the country, creating a competition between colleges and universities all over the United States. Ultimately, Harvard University would go on to win the contest, but the University of Idaho was the runner up, being nicknamed the “Bloodiest Campus in the Nation.”[^84] Reeves would continue to participate in donating his blood throughout his life, which by 2016 totaled [^85]and by 2020, 50 gallons.[^86]  


While attending class, between 1950 and 1952, Reeves helped instruct in the ROTC program on campus,[^87] and in 1952, his last year of law school, Reeves submitted an essay for the national Nathan Burkan Memorial Contest titled “Loss of Literary Property in Comic Strips,” a contest in which no law student from the University of Idaho had competed before.[^88] Reeves won the competition, seeing his paper published in the Copyright Law Symposium the next year.[^89] Reeves’ charitable nature would continue after school with the foundation of his Sun Valley Charitable Foundation and the thousands of pounds of donations he sent to impoverished places across the world.[^90]

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg-1953-12-08_p1-reeves" %}

Reeves has received many awards throughout the years, with his first two awards being awarded to him in 2002: the Commander’s Award for Public Service and the Outstanding Civil Service Medal (two medals that had never been awarded in the Western United States  before).[^91] He found himself inducted into the University of Idaho’s Alumni Hall of Fame in 2004,[^92] and he also earned the Award of Legal Merit at the University in 2020.[^93] He has received the Idaho State Bar’s Service Award in 2012 and the Richard C. Fields Award, also from the Idaho State Bar, in 2015 for his civility, professionalism, and outreach in the community.[^94] If all these awards were not enough, Reeves also earned the American Red Cross Heroes Award for his continued donation of blood and needed items.[^95] Reeves’ story is one of true remarkability that showcases the tenacity and integrity of many Black students at the University of Idaho.

## _Black Greek Life_ ## 

Black Greek Letter organizations have served as significant institutions for Black students on campuses across the US. A study produced in 2008 noted that Black fraternities and sororities “...facilitated the cultural adjustment and membership of minority student participants by serving as sources of cultural familiarity, vehicles for cultural expression and advocacy, and venues for cultural validation.”[^96] Another study in 2001 notes that “minority students perceive that membership within multicultural organizations provides them greater opportunities to share their skills and talents with the African American community.”[^97]  

These two different studies conclude that Black Greek organizations provide much needed support to Black students at Predominantly White Universities, helping Black students to integrate at the university while also improving academic success and student retention. The vital importance, then, of these organizations to Black students on campuses, such as can be seen with cultural centers and student unions, is in their (Black Greek organizations) ability to provide an inclusive and safe space for students of color. Another study in 2006 further noted the improvement of Black students due to the Greek organizations, concluding that enrollment in these entities provided Black students with a better college experience that then encouraged them to reach out to other Black students not in their fraternity.[^98]

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg-03-20-1984-steppingout" %}

The development of Black fraternities could be seen at least in part as resulting from the success of student-athletes like those earlier described.  Their success encouraged more Black students to enroll at the University of Idaho through the athletics department and also encouraged the University to step up Black recruitment. The growth of Black students on campus can be seen in the two Black fraternities that popped up on campus: a chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha in 1975[^99] and the Alpha Alpha Zeta chapter of the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity in 1992.[^100] There was also the “Alpha Angels,” who were the sorority chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha and who helped the fraternity with events.[^101] Sadly, all three of these chapters are no longer active.

## _Black Studies at U of I_ ##

The impacts of the University of Idaho’s recruitment were felt further into the late 1960s as several students began floating around petitions for the adoption of Black studies courses. The first of these was a petition in 1966 for the adoption of Anthropology 158, “Race Problems,” which was aimed to teach university students about the underlying causes that gave way to racial problems.[^102] This petition did not have many signatures, and it seems that there were no real actions taken by the University from it, but it would serve as a base for later petitions. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ug13_251_003" %}

Around this time, the fight for Black Studies programs had grown quite large, with the Civil Rights movement pushing for greater inclusivity at universities. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 had made it so that educational institutes could not ban anyone on account of the color of their skin, inspiring strikes such as the ones at the San Francisco State College in 1968 and 1969 that resulted in many new rights for Black students and other students of color.[^103] As such, these changes quickly brought more Black students to universities and further increased Black voices on campuses. The fight for Black studies programs on campuses increased further after the murders of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, with Black students insisting that Black studies programs were necessary in order to improve their situation and to educate the White students. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ug13_251_002" %}

In 1968, another set of petitions was distributed to the student population by **Joseph A. Tasby, a Black student-athlete**. These sets of petitions received much more attention than the one in 1966, garnering over **400 signatures** and creating “noise” in the history department and the President’s office.[^104] The petitions were intended to re-activate the Anthropology 158 course and to create a new Black history course titled “The Negro in America” for the 1969 school year.[^105] These petitions, as mentioned above, made a commotion within the faculty ranks of the University, and as such, President Ernest Hartung responded to Tasby by stating that if the University could implement the courses, then it would make the University undoubtedly a better educational institute.[^106]

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ug13_251_005;ug13_251_001" %}

Despite this backing from President Hartung, the History Department was unsure of how to proceed with implementing a course focused on the Black community at the University. One argument brought up was that neither Jews nor women had their own specific course, and Black history was already being taught in other subjects, which would lead to redundancy if the new course was implemented. There was also the issue of recruiting an instructor, as the petitions had called for a Black history course to be taught by a Black professor; however, the University of Idaho did have issues in the past when it came to recruiting Black professors. This was due to several reasons, the biggest being **the perception that not many Black professors were interested in coming to the University of Idaho**. These issues combined, leading to a stalemate in 1969 with no ground being broken and the creation of a Black history course being left up in the air. 

However, this would not remain the case as Professors Siegfried B. Rolland and Willard Barnes, who both happened to be White, would restate the issue in memorandums they wrote in 1970.[^107] These memorandums argued for the case of having such a course as well as proposed the intended structure of said course. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="r96" %}

Although senior administrators would have to approve the course, **students and faculty were the driving forces** behind this initiative. This is why racially and ethnically diverse administrators are important, something that will be discussed later on in the document. This is a key issue that will reappear throughout the Black history at the University of Idaho, with faculty taking matters into their hands to create programs designed to educate and promote Black culture on campus. With the work done by Professors Rolland and Barnes, the discussion surrounding the implementation of these courses was brought back to light in early 1970, when a meeting was held and it was decided that Black courses would be implemented for the 1970-1971 catalog year.[^108]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="mg368_f60_002" %}

The implementation of the “The Negro in America” history course was instrumental in the history of Black studies as it paved the way for more courses to be implemented, and it also saw to it that the University focused more on educating about Black history on campus. However, it should still be noted that these courses were handled almost exclusively by the professors within their respective departments instead of senior management for the University of Idaho. The efforts of Drs. Rolland and Barnes, the student population, and the Washington State University sociology department’s Black faculty (most notably Ken Johnson) saw to it that these courses were implemented. However, it would be an oversight not mention the efforts of Professor Jack Davis and his work in the Black literature course. 

**Professor Jack Davis** joined the English Department at the University of Idaho in 1967 after graduating from the University of New Mexico with his PhD in American studies. In 1970, under pressure from the student body at the University, Professor Davis took up the English 327 course “Black Literature,” and he also began instructing a Native American literature course. At this time, Professor Davis was one of the only faculty members of color at the University of Idaho (he identified as Native American), and as such, his role in these courses shows a substantial shift in University policy. On top of teaching these new courses, he was also appointed as the first coordinator for the Black Studies Program and the American Indian Studies Program at the University.[^109]  

Dr. Davis’s work at the University, together with his presence, served as auspicious signs that the environment was beginning to change and that students and faculty of color were more of a priority than they had been in previous years. The policy change indicated here implies that there was some support for the establishment of a Black studies program at the University of Idaho.

Late in 1970, several drafts and memorandums were written in the discussion of funds for the “The Negro in America” history course and the Black literature course. These memorandums were sent mostly between Rolland and Robert Coonrod, the vice president of academics at the time, and Joe Watts, the University's business manager at the time. One of these memorandums, from Coonrod to Davis, discussed the talks Coonrod, Rolland, and Barnes had held about the optimal funds being $2,000 for the initial course and an additional $1,500 for books.[^110] Though these initial funding points had been talked over, the level of funding asked for was not initially met, and when further funded, the amount was still lower than the $3,500 asked for. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="r139" %}

The starting budget for the “The Negro in America” history course was $1,000, though Dr. Rolland asked that the price be raised by $600 to cover film purchases and rentals.[^111] Dr. Davis asked for $1,500 for the Black literature course, though he argued that $2,000 would be more ideal for covering speakers, films, and books.[^112] Funding would continue with more money shifted from departments like the Office of Intercultural Programs to continue to grow these courses.[^113] From there, the Black studies program at the University was able to grow further and add additional classes that had not been offered before. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="r145; r144" %}

{% include feature/image.html objectid="h16" %}

**By the summer of 1971, the two-course program had added another five courses dealing with different aspects of Black history and culture around the world.** The five courses added were maintained within the College of Letters and Arts in concert with the “The Negro in America” history course and Black literature, as this was where the main pressure from faculty on this matter had been. The five courses added were Anthropology 320 (Peoples of the World), Anthropology and Sociology 322 (Racial and Ethnic Minorities), Anthropology 427 (Peoples of Africa), Political Science 485 (African Political Systems), and Social Science 103 (Introduction to Black Culture).[^114] The addition of more courses shows that the initiative to help diversify the learning culture of the University was present and that the student population was also interested in learning more about Black history and culture. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="h23" %}

The support for the Black Studies Program can be seen in the rosters of “The Negro in America” history course for the spring of 1976, which was full.[^115] This would fit with the entusiasm for Black studies of the 1970s, in which many universities adopted Black studies programs as the Civil Rights movement progressed.[^116] This led to issues with many of these courses as they were taught almost exclusively by White professors, excluding Jack Davis’s Black literature course. which resulted in perceptions that instructors of these courses did not have the correct experience to be teaching about Black history so much so that there was eventually a controversy later in the program’s life regarding this fact as Black faculty were annoyed with being taught “Black History on a White Platter.”[^117]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="r175;r149" %}

## _Black Student Union_ ##

The criticisms and push for inclusivity at the University of Idaho were in large part due to the efforts of the Black student population on campus, even though it was initially much smaller than its current numbers. The Black student population during the late 1960s and early 1970s was almost entirely composed of Black student-athletes who had come to the University of Idaho seeking growth. **These Black student-athletes pioneered the origins of the Black Student Union (BSU) in 1971 when they joined together and drafted the “Rationale for the Black Student Union.”**  This document, though brief, gives vital information into the design of what these Black student-athletes on campus at the time wanted to accomplish, with their main goals being to advocate the importance of Black culture and combat racism and ignorance by creating a center for cultural interaction.[^118]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="h13_115" %}

Looking at one of the BSU’s goals, cultural centers at universities have continuously been at the forefront for many students of color across the United States. The most notable beginning of the demands for Black cultural centers is noted as having been around the 1960s and 1970s, during the Black Student Movement of the time. In the book titled _Culture Centers in Higher Education_, by Lori D. Patton, it is observed that many Black students demands for Black cultural centers were intertwined with the idea of seeing Black culture in higher academia. Patton notes that “in essence they wanted to see their culture recognized in academics (curriculum and faculty), social life (student activities, residential life), and administrative affairs (financial aid, admissions).[^119]

Following this, Patton also highlights that these demands where fought to make Black students’ campus environment more conducive cultural centers were sought out by Black students who (after the establishment of centers on campuses) noted that cultural centers acted as a “Home away from Home.”  And while the perception of these cultural centers at Predominantly White Institutions is that of a segregation from White students, Black cultural centers in actuality have served as learning spaces for all students. Many Black studies programs have started at these cultural centers with the intention of helping to better educate White persons on campus about Black culture and history. As such, these centers have not only served as safe spaces for Black students on campuses, but also as the focal points of Black student activism on campus that have sought to increase their presence in higher academia.

With this context given in relation to one of the BSU’s overall goals, the original six founders of the Black Student Union were all Black student-athletes, and those six Black student-athletes were **Malcolm Smith (President of the BSU), Adrian Prince (Treasurer of the BSU), Jesse Craig, Jay Wheeler, Loren Dantzler, and Robert Lee Williams.**[^120]  

Malcolm Smith was the first President of the BSU and came to the University of Idaho as a junior transfer from Chicago, Illinois, to play as a running back on the Vandals football team. Adrian Prince, also known as Adrian “The Prince,” was the first Treasurer of the BSU and came from Saginaw, Michigan, in 1967, looking to play on the Vandals basketball team. Jesse Craig came from Los Angeles, California, and was recruited by the University of Idaho primarily for the Vandals football team. Jay Wheeler was one of the more outspoken members of the original six, competing on the track-and-field team. He hosted a radio show and wrote several editorial pieces in the _Argonaut_. Loren Dantzler came to the University as a junior transfer from San Diego in 1970 to play baseball. And finally, Robert Lee Williams was recruited by the University of Idaho to play as a running back and receiver for the Vandals football team. 

These BSU members, again being Black student-athletes, undertook the process of establishing a Black student union by themselves and without support from senior leadership at the University. And while they later did receive some support from the University, **the initiative needed on the part of senior leadership would not be present, and the relationship between these two entities (BSU and senior leadership) would crumble. **

One of the major points brought up within “Rationale for the Black Student Union” was the need for a safe space in which Black students could come together with one another and engage in an inclusive cultural exchange. The BSU would gain a place of its own when it moved into the College Master’s House at 706 Deakin Ave, which sat just across the street from the Student Union Building.[^121] With the garnering of a space, the BSU was able to formally open its doors to the public in 1971 and act as a place for Black students to congregate with one another. It must be noted that the original six founders of the BSU had not been given the building free of charge and had instead entered into a contract with the University saying that they would pay monthly installments on it, which would become an issue for the BSU later.[^122] However, at this point in time, the BSU’s biggest issue was funding, as it was a brand new student organization that was not under the direct control of the University. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="pg1_003-21-zoom;h13_110" %}

**The funding** of the BSU became such an issue that faculty members at the University voiced their opinions to President Hartung in their own letters. One such letter from Professor R. A. Hughes pushed back against the requested funds from the University, arguing that he believed “... it contrary to the ideals of democracy for a state to institutionalize separate facilities to accommodate a minority group based on race.”[^123] President Hartung would respond to Professor Hughes with a letter of his own, stating that

> This Union made a request to the University for space in which to develop an educational and cultural center, and it is the space this provided that has erroneously been referred to as the Black Student Union. The provision of space is on a contractual basis and the Black Student Union is paying rental for it, which while admittedly is modest, is nonetheless in keeping with longstanding University policy in providing land for construction of fraternity and sorority houses, or of providing such houses on a temporary basis, at minimum rental fee.[^124]

{% include feature/image.html objectid="against-bsu_1971-03-17;h13_145" %}

President Hartung would end this letter by simply stating that while the BSU was renting the house contractually from the University, the University was “...not providing continuing support for the organization called the Black Student Union” (Hartung 1971). The contractual nature of the relationship between the BSU and the University would be one of the many issues that would lead to the reduced presence of the BSU on campus. 

During its time at the College Master’s House, the BSU held several open houses and made the general public well aware of the new student organization. There were several pieces written in the _Argonaut_ to showcase the new BSU, with several pieces being written by Jay Wheeler to help promote a Black culture on campus.[^125]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg-1971-03-17_p005" %}

## _Black Cultural Week_ ##

The BSU also **hosted their “Black Cultural Week”** wherein Black culture would be celebrated with the goal of greater student outreach and educating White students. The first Black Cultural Week was held on the week of April 9, 1972, with the _Argonaut_ continuously reporting on its events.[^126] Though a success in terms of new ground broken, the _Argonaut_ reported that it saw little traffic.[^127] This was more or less confirmed in the following year, in which the Black Cultural Week was not able to fulfill the financial requests from the Associated Students of the University of Idaho, or the ASUI (who had allowed them to borrow $650 for the event and only received $33 back), straining the relationship between the BSU and the ASUI.[^128] 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg-1972-04-07_p1-culturalweek;arg-1972-04-14_p9-whatshappening" %}

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg-1973-05-08_p5-bsu" %}

The BSU held another series of events in 1974, but with little public attention, this seems to have been the last year the BSU put it on. The BSU also produced an Organizational Statement for the 1972-1973 school year in which they announced they would open a reading room in the house, operate a cultural awareness program that would meet bi-weekly to discuss the Black experience on campus, manage a Black orientation program for new Black students, run a Pan-African interexchange for discussion between African and African-American students, and finally teach an Afro-American studies course.[^129] However, the cracks were beginning to show in the relationship between the BSU and the senior leadership of the University as the issue of money came up again. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="h13_112" %}

## _Black Cultural Center/Student Living_ ##

In a memorandum from June 19, 1972, Thomas E. Richardson, Vice President of the University, wrote to Dr. Sherman Carter saying that the original rental agreement the University had with the BSU had not worked out well. He stated that the main reason was that the BSU was limiting “...the use of the house for full development of different programs” (Richardson 1972).[^130] Due to this issue, Richardson noted that the live-in provision of the house, wherein BSU members had been staying there, was to be revoked and that the house was to be placed under the responsibility of the Physical Plant Division of the University. Under this new agreement, the BSU was still able to utilize the house, but the BSU members were not allowed to use it as a dormitory or office for its members. In a memorandum in that same summer, Richardson would also note that the BSU house would change from a family housing unit rental to a Minority Students Center, operated by the BSU.[^131]

{% include feature/image.html objectid="h13_105;h13_107" %}

The BSU would remain in the College Master’s house as the Minority Student Center until early 1973, when a freezing winter would blow into Moscow and freeze the piping, doing substantial damage to the property. The damage was so extensive that the building was closed indefinitely, leaving the BSU without a home from which it could operate. Instead of renovating the building, the University would later choose to demolish it with several others in the area. 

Around this time it also seems that the BSU had become less active compared to its start in 1971, as noted by an _Argonaut_ article produced in 1973. The _Argonaut_ article titled “BSU: A case of Apathy?” reported on the indefinite closing of the house, but states that “Black students tend to be less interested or completely uninformed of a Black Student Union at Idaho.”[^132] Bernard Hamilton, a counselor for the BSU in 1973, notes that while this may be the case, the main pressing issues were the lack of a Black student population on campus and a lack of diversity. Whatever the case may have been at the time, it seems that the BSU did not have as much of an outreach on campus as it had initially desired. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg_1973-01-23_p01" %}

Once the BSU had essentially been kicked out of the College Master’s House, they were in close contact with Vice President Richardson in regard to finding a new home for the organization. Richardson connected the BSU to Matt Telin, the Chairman of the Space Allocations Committee, sending their space request to him in a memorandum shortly after the closing of the College Master’s House. Within the memorandum, Richardson notes that the space the BSU had been allocated was known to not likely last beyond 1975, but the sudden deterioration of the building was unexpected. Richardson also voiced his support for the BSU later in the memorandum, stating that “I mention this because I believe that even though it will be difficult to meet space needs for this type of program, the University’s commitment in this area is clear and a maximum effort should be made to support minority student programming.”[^133]  The BSU would manage to relocate to the Canterbury House, Episcopal Student Center where it would remain under a semi-permanent arrangement.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="spaceallocation" %}

With a space safely secured, the BSU was able to reopen and begin its operation again on campus. Though there is not much remaining documentation to show whether 1973 was eventful for BSU, it is clear that 1974 was eventful, with the BSU publishing a communique to the University administration. The **“Communique from the Black Student Union”** is a crucial document in the BSU’s history and outlines several key issues that the BSU (and Black students) faced on campus and the changes needed to improve the campus. **Within the document, the BSU listed several accounts of racist activity on campus, with the two biggest incidents being the conflict between Black students and the Dormitory Administration on campus, and an incident regarding a radio personality employed by the University.** 

## _Racial Harassment_ ##

Analyzing the communique, the first issue discussed is the conflict between Black students and the Dormitory Administration, the BSU provided an example saying that “White Dormitory Administration culturally forcing Black students to accept White Dietary Habits (that White students won’t even accept), and when Black students protest they are fined and penalized.”[^134] This incident is interesting as it highlights a smaller employment of systemic racism within the University at the time that did target the Black student population. An added difficulty for these Black students was that they were confined to on-campus living. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ug074-26" %}

The second major incident recorded in the document was the employment of a radio host to a federally funded radio station that wore **Ku Klux Klan robes and who the BSU noted as being a member of the Ku Klux Klan.** This incident was a more open and recognizable sign of racism on campus and was a bigger issue as this individual was also a security guard for the University and patrolled the dormitory where Black students had to live. These incidents of racism showcased that the University environment of 1974 was not as accepting towards students of color as it may have painted itself to be, which in turn forced the BSU to make a list of ten demands to establish a more secure place for Black students on campus. 

This incident was important, not only as a security guard for the University was a member of the KKK, but also because North Idaho is an area known for its dark history with hate groups, especially the Aryan Nations.  In 1973, the Aryan Nations had established a compound in Hayden, Idaho, only an hour and 40 minutes from the University. A well-known and documented hate group, they persisted in the North Idaho area until the 2000s, when they were kicked out of the region through legal action and bankruptcy. However, at their peak, they had a strong grip over the area. They were even declared a “terrorist threat” by the FBI in 2001, and they allied themselves closely with KKK groups in the area.[^135] With this given context, there is a greater insight into why the Black students on campus felt afraid and betrayed by the senior administration of the University. With a known member of the KKK on campus, someone who openly supported the KKK, the direct nature of the BSU’s message to the University certainly made sense.

The list of ten demands included in the document was as follows: (1) the hiring of more Black faculty in Admissions, Financial Aid, Faculty, and the Athletics Department; (2) an audit of the Financial Aids Department and Cultural Exchange program to check the allocation of federal funds under a three-man committee (Dr. Hartung, Ed Reed, and the State Attorney General); (3) an investigation into the hiring procedures at U of I; (4) research into the financial needs of minority undergraduate and graduate students; (5) immediate hiring of a minority as the Director of the Inter-Cultural Programs; (6) hiring of Black faculty in the Student Advisory Services; (7) the implementation of a Black Cultural Institute; (8) the establishment of a comprehensive Black Studies Program; (9) minorities being excluded from discriminatory policies of the Dorm Administration; and (10) the allowance of off-campus living for Black athletes. 

These demands indicate the increased activity of the BSU on campus and also address the BSU’s desire for change at a much higher level within University management. This list of demands indicates that the BSU felt the University was not as inclusive as senior leadership  may have made it out to be, but this can also be noticed in the language used within the document. An example of this can be seen later in the document where the BSU begins to address the Ku Klux Klan incident on campus. They state: 


In these times of 1974 Black Students can no longer stand by and permit an all White Administration and [its] White Directors to Determine the Destiny of Black Students and here again White Administrators attempting to conduct a Black Studies Department with a White Administrator Employed to the task. Just as men can longer speak for women, Whites Can No Longer Think for Black People.[^136]  

This type of speech indicates that the BSU was tired of the current senior leadership and the lack of policy being directed at fixing the uniform nature of the 1974 White University campus. This document’s speech and its public release no doubt put greater pressure on senior leadership at the University to act. To further ensure that something would be done, the document also includes that if nothing is done, the BSU will employ Black political methods to accomplish their goals, which could have meant anything from campus sit-ins to protests.  The BSU was able to effectively utilize this document as President Hartung responded to the BSU by their deadline of April 22 and thoroughly discussed the demands raised.

Taking a look at the response provided by President Hartung and the further response of other faculty members at the University, **administration and faculty seem to have wanted to work with the BSU, for the most part.** In his six-page letter to the BSU, Hartung answers the demands listed by the BSU to the best of his ability and he does a fairly good job at it. At the beginning of his letter, he mentions that in the 1972-1973 school year, 37 Black students had enrolled and attended the University. Broken down further, five had enrolled, 15 had left, and 17 had returned for the academic year.[^137] This provides valuable insight as it showcases that while the Black student population on campus at the time was small, it had grown since the first wave of Black student-athletes had been enrolled. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ha144" %}

The next point discussed was the BSU’s fifth demand of hiring a minority as the Director of the Intercultural Programs, which Hartung says cannot be unilaterally agreed upon as the University has had a hard time hiring Black faculty and the current Director is liked by other minority student groups on campus. The two other high notes for the BSU in Hartung’s response are that the on-campus living situation would be resolved in the next school year, allowing Black student-athletes to live off-campus and that the University would welcome an audit if conducted by the Idaho Commission on Human Rights. The University also agreed to the organization of a Juntura committee to oversee the implementation of a Minority Students Program that would aid minority students academically on campus. 

 However, President Hartung in turn dismisses other points made by the BSU concerning the hiring of more Black faculty, having a comprehensive Black Studies program, and implementing a Black Cultural Center. These three areas are dismissed by Hartung for two reasons: the lack of a diverse population in North Idaho, and the limited financial resources of the University. This is better explained by Hartung, who states, 


> The University is located from large, diversified Black populations from which it can attract students and on which it can depend for support for any on-going Black Cultural Institutes or programs. In other words, while we must and will continue to enroll and assist Black students, primary obligation to the people of Idaho, the taxpayers who largely support the institution, suggest the University must also address itself increasingly to a vast number of proliferating state needs.[^138] 

The argument made by Hartung does give valid reasoning as to the difficulties the University had with recruiting Black students and faculty, as well as why there were not enough readily available funds for new programs. Nevertheless, the University still appeared to have continued funds for expanding international student recruitment, the Athletics Department, and other strategic priorities. 

Although the University decided against instituting the more major changes demanded by the BSU, there was progress made within the Juntura committee toward setting up the Minority Students Program. Several memorandums were sent that initially set up the program, naming specific courses and positions within it and further detailing the plan to institute it.[^139] Charles A. Ramsey II would be the first director called to the position, helping to build it into an organization that would have more say on campus. It is clear that this program, out of all proposed by the BSU in 1974, saw the most success, as documentation exhibits that it saw continued development past the BSU’s departure and into the 1980s. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ha193" %}

The growth of the program can be seen in the 1976 Capsule Report written up by Ramsey and delivered to the Juntura Committee. From the 1974-1975 school year to the 1975-1976 school year, the Minority Students Program increased from a budget of just under $20,000 to a budget of just above $31,000.[^140] The increase noted here shows that the program continued to grow and was able to secure more funding from the University, implying that the University did see this program as necessary and important. This is not to say that it saw no issues, as memorandums between Ramsey and other faculty members indicate that the program still had a difficult time in both publicity and organization.[^141]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="h79;h74" %}

The program was further reorganized when Ramsey resigned in 1977 and, due to this, the Juntura committee decided it would be best to hire **three minority education specialists** (Chicano, Native American, and Black) instead of one director.[^142] Continued support of this progress showcases that the University did place importance on its students of color, but that it did not feel necessary to work with each group on a more personalized level. And though this program did work successfully for the University and its students of color, the other programs the BSU wanted were deemed unessential at the time.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ha54" %}

These issues between the Black student population and the senior leadership at the University concerning increased inclusivity would remain unchanged for several decades and locked behind University bureaucratic red tape and a lack of initiative on senior leadership’s part. And as for the BSU in the 1970s, this would be their last major activity; in 1975, they once again lost access to a space and had to depart from the Canterbury Center. The University demolished the building in 1976 to make way for People’s Park, severely limiting the ability of the BSU to operate on campus.[^143]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ha70" %}

The BSU, without a space secured, underwent organizational changes in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, rebranding themselves as the Black and African Student Association (BASA).[^144] This closing of a rather active period of the University of Idaho BSU could be compared to that of a closing door, with not much progress being made in the way of furthering Black students and faculty at the University. Despite this inactivity, the push for a more inclusive experience at the University of Idaho would be reignited in the 2000s with the revival of the BSU presence on campus.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg_1978-04-14" %}

## _Prominent Black Faculty Member: Dr. Florence Anna “Pat” White_ ##

During this period of inactivity for the BSU, Black history was still being recorded in a recognizable way with the College of Education’s first known Black tenured professor. Dr. Florence Anna “Pat” White came to the University of Idaho in 1976 as a graduate assistant.[^145] Before her time at the University, she earned her bachelor's degree in elementary education at Langston University in Langston, Oklahoma, in 1963. She then taught at the Matt Kelly Elementary School in Las Vegas, Nevada, as a classroom teacher from 1963-1967, and as a head start teacher at Matt Kelly Elementary from 1964-1966. After the 1967 school year, Dr. White would leave Matt Kelly Elementary and begin teaching at Vegas Verdes Elementary school. She would remain at Vegas Verdes until 1970, again moving schools, this time to Buckman Elementary School in Portland, Oregon, and teaching there until 1976.[^146]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg-1977-04-26_p8-faculty" %}

After her time at Buckman, Dr. White seems to have moved on from elementary teaching, teaching exclusively at the University of Idaho, finishing her graduate assistantship in 1978 and advancing towards her tenure position. After serving as a graduate assistant and completing her doctoral studies at the University, she began serving as a full-time faculty member at the University of Idaho. Dr. White progressed on, later becoming an associate professor at the University and serving the institution for ten years. It is recorded that sometime during the 1980s and 1990s, she was given a tenured position at the University; however, the exact date is unknown. 

Dr. White seems to have been quite involved at the University, being present for Juntura meetings in 1978 and 1981.[^147] She was further involved in more University affairs, serving on a Vice President of Student Affairs search committee[^148] and a faculty council in 1989.[^149] During the 1990-1991 school year, she taught two courses as an associate professor in the College of Education: ED 201 (Intro to Teaching) and ED 581 (Systematic and Objective Analysis Instruction or SOAI). After the 1993 school year, the record of Dr. White seems to trail off for the most part, with the next mention of her name being her memorial in 2020.[^150] While there is not much record of Dr. White’s time at the University of Idaho, she is one of the first known Black tenured professors at the University and in the College of Education. Her involvement at the University also showcases that there was some approval for having tenured Black professors at the University of Idaho.

## _Prominent Black Friend of the University: Lionel Hampton_ ##

Black history was further recorded at the University with the **arrival of Lionel Hampton.** Hampton, a Jazz musician from Louisville, Kentucky, made quite a name for himself in the 20th century, becoming an international sensation with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra. A musical prodigy, Hampton wrote over 200 musical works and established two of his very own record label companies, which only further spiraled him into the spotlight. 

His first appearance at the University of Idaho was in 1984, when he and his New York band performed at the Jazz Festival.[^151] His performance at the Jazz Festival must have had some profound effect on himself and the community, as he would return in 1985 to perform again, but this time at the newly renamed Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival.[^152] This relationship between Hampton and the University continued, with the University renaming its music school to the Lionel Hampton School of Music in 1987 and gifting Hampton an honorary doctorate degree in 1988.[^153]  

With knowledge of the University’s seeming interest in furthering Jazz, and Hampton’s participation in the festival, many other iconic Black musicians, like Dizzy Gillespie and Ella Fitzgerald, would find their way to the University of Idaho. The Jazz Festival was a stunning success with international attention, thanks to the efforts of Lionel Hampton, who would continue to play at the festival until his unfortunate passing on August 31, 2002.[^154] Despite his passing, the Lionel Hampton International Music Festival (renamed in 2006) was awarded the National Medal of the Arts in 2007. Hampton’s time at the University had a profound impact not only towards the Black history on campus, but also to the musical experience and education offered.

# Present (2000-Present) #

The University of Idaho campus in present times is very similar to the campus of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s in regard to the smaller population of students and faculty of color  connected to the University. Taking a look at the general population of the University in the 2000-2001 school year, the total undergraduate Black student population enrolled at the time was 57 out of 8,759 students, and the total for faculty of color on campus (which includes Black, Latinx, and Native-American) was 43 out of 600 faculty.[^155] While the numbers reported for Black students and faculty are low, it does show that the University had become more diverse than it had been in its earlier years of Black student enrichment and Black faculty instruction. 

Another report from the 2002-2003 school year also indicates this progress as the numbers of Black students and faculty of color both increased, with Black students numbering 65 out of 9,368 students and faculty of color rising to 50 out of 611 faculty members.[^156] These numbers indicate that the University was slowly catching up in terms of better recruitment practices to encourage a more diverse campus. The increased number of Black students and faculty on campus not only diversified the student population but also actively saw the increase of Black student organizations on campus and a greater Black voice. This increased voice and activity led to the revitalization of the Black Student Union on campus, which led to an effective movement towards establishing a Black identity on campus.

## _BSU to BASA to RAACE to BSU again_ ##

The Black and African Student Association (BASA), which had originally been the BSU, was renamed during the 1990s to Recognizing African-American Concerns and Education (RAACE) and acted as a combined element of Black student groups on campus. However, the group had become less active by around 2004, and there was no real activity at the time in correlation with Black students. **Jessica Samuels, an Academic Success Counselor at the University (in 2016)**, came to campus around 2004 as an undergraduate student. She noted that the revitalization of the BSU during this time was mostly done by older and non-traditional students for about a year and a half. During this time, she also notes, the BSU had managed to recruit some younger students, which she hoped would help the BSU continue its growth. 

As a confirmation of this, an _Argonaut_ article from November 2005 notes that a graduate student named Sherwin James was the BSU president and that he had announced the group’s renewal. According to the article, the BSU was reopened in February 2005, coinciding with Black History Month, and Sherwin James organized a meeting with student-athletes and BSU members to hear from Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Alan Page.[^157] The _Argonaut_ article also mentions Jessica Samuels, who was planning a memorial event for Rosa Parks’ passing. This activity shows that the BSU in 2005 was reinvigorated and had a restructured organization that sought to increase the Black voice on campus. Despite this increased activity, Samuels mentions that after she and other graduate students left the school to continue their higher education, the BSU’s activity dwindled again and left the BSU somewhat inactive as it had been in the 1980s and 1990s. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="arg_2005-11-15" %}

## _Modern Challenges_ ##

This inactivity of the BSU was unfortunate for the modern campus of the University of Idaho, as it serves as both the voice for Black students on campus and a safe haven. Not having this essential component of the modern university that exists at most campuses limited the ability of the University of Idaho to look more appealing to Black students—and Black faculty for that matter. It also made it harder for Black students coming from different cultural climates to adjust to an area that is overwhelmingly White and has a racist history, as aforementioned. This can be seen in the experiences of Black students who attended the University of Idaho and who felt more or less alone. 

Marcis Fennell, a Black student-athlete who attended the University from 2004-2008 (undergrad), 2010-2011 (master’s), and 2015-2017 (doctorate) and obtained his PhD in sport pedagogy and character education, had a somewhat negative experience at the University. He noted that during his time as a student-athlete, there were no real Black student organizations that supported him. He also said there was not a lot of support from the Athletic Department either, commenting that the only real base of support he had was from fellow teammates on the football team. 

The experiences Fennell had regarding the lacking presence and outreach of the BSU showcase why the University has struggled when it comes to supporting Black students, the irony being that the BSU was founded by Black students. If Black students at the University do not have organized support, then their experiences are sure to be tarnished and they cannot be expected to feel comfortable on campus grounds. 

Wyryor Noil, a Black student-athlete at the University of Idaho pursuing his master’s degree in education, commented similarly concerning the BSU’s presence. He noted that he did not really know of any Black student organizations on campus that had reached out to him and offered him support. The inactivity of the BSU in more present history showcases the negative effects of its absence on Black students at the University of Idaho. Although the BSU has been off-and-on in terms of activity, recently there has been more progress made toward reinstating its presence on campus. If a graph was designed to display the activity of the BSU on campus, it would display a notable rise around 2018 with BSU-supported Black Lives Matter Protests.[^158] The activity increased further after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, and this pushed the BSU towards securing and reaffirming their presence at the University of Idaho. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="bsu_2018-03-23_protest_01" %}

## _Fight to Reestablish the Black Cultural Center_ ##

One of the key things the BSU had been lacking during recent years was a permanent space to hold meetings and for Black students to gather. Supporters of a revitalized BSU also wanted to cement their own affairs office, similar to that of the Multicultural Affairs Office and the Native American Student Center. In 2020, former BSU president **Alphonse Crittenden** applied for a more permanent home in the Idaho Student Union Building (ISUB) for a Black Cultural Center.[^159] The request for space was further supported by the BSU advisors Lynda Freeman and Jessica Samuels, conveying that the BSU students had the backing of Black faculty on campus.[^160] Crittenden worked with Dr. Sydney Freeman Jr. in writing the request, a process that took over a year to complete. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="initial_proposal_for_reestablishment_of_the_black_cultural_center;letter_of_support_from_bsu_advisors" %}

The request was granted in 2021, giving the BSU a designated space, something it had been without since 1975—a monumental moment for Black students on campus and 50 years in the making. The space given was smaller than what was originally desired, but students were still excited and appreciative of finally regaining a space of their own. The establishment of a space for the BSU was followed by the hiring of a director, Mario Pile, to the Black Cultural/Student Center that now resides on campus.[^161] This accelerated growth in more recent history paints a strong picture for the revival of the BSU on campus and highlights its revamped initiative in terms of making a difference on campus. The BSU, at its current point, is arguably the strongest it has been during its 50 years on campus and it is thanks to the efforts of Black students and faculty that have strived to make the University a more diverse place. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="mariopile_01" %}

## _“Shades of Black” Cultural Event_ ##

Academics for Black students has been another key element that has improved at the University of Idaho, coming far from its early days in the 20th century. The 21st century  has seen a greater push from both Black students and faculty towards developing more highly organized educational programs. These programs have come in many sizes and forms, but they have altered the University in a way that has created a more educated student population when it comes to Black Culture. 

The first of these programs was in 2003 when an architecture and sociology student at the University of Idaho, Kwapi Vengesayi, decided that he wanted to create a cultural showcase for the community of Moscow. The Shades of Black show has been continuously celebrated during Black History Month at the University of Idaho and has been sponsored by the Multicultural Affairs Office, the Black Student Union, the African Student Association, the Martin Institute, and others.[^162] This event has sought to highlight Black culture and to spark conversation regarding racial issues that are constantly occurring, in a way that might not be otherwise easily obtainable. 

## _Africa Night_ ##

Another important student program is the Africa Night program, put on by the African Student Association, to “...showcase the various cultures of Africa using dance, music, poetry and food to show the face of Africa.”[^163] The organizers of this event, the African Student Association, or the ASA, are a group of International students from Africa whose purpose is to “...promote and preserve cultural heritage of Africans through activities and events.”  This event, with the Shades of Black event, have aimed to increase the education diversity at the campus, and they have been directed by the Black and African student populations on campus. 

## _National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)_ ##

Academically, there are a few Black student organizations on campus that also aim towards promoting Black excellence, with the biggest being the Idaho chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. The NSBE has had much outreach in the community, notably contributing during their Keys to Success events and Dynamic Engineers Lecture Series in recent years.[^164] They also received national recognition during the 2014 40th annual NSBE convention, competing against 200 different chapters and earning the 2013-2014 Highest GPA Award, the Chapter Relief Award, and the Most Active Chapter of the Year Award.[^165]  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="nsbe-ui_dels_2019_01" %}

## _Black Law Association_ ##

The Black Law Association, which used to operate on campus, sought to help promote Black students in the legal field. This student organization has given way to new and important programs that continue to be at the forefront of Black academic and cultural excellence on campus.

## _Black Lives Matter Speaker Series_ ##

The University also adopted the Black Lives Matter Speaker Series in 2020, which was funded by the Multicultural Affairs Office and other campus sponsors and  holds keynotes and workshops for . According to the organizers, the reason the series was created was “...for our campus and community to listen, engage and take action to dismantle systemic racism in our society.”[^166]  

The introduction of this series to campus in 2020, around the time of the murder of George Floyd, indicates that there was a desire to have more conversations about race on campus and that the University was undergoing change. The desire for change on campus from students and faculty has driven the University towards becoming a more inclusive space, and it has garnered more support from senior leadership than other programs have in the past. 

## _Black History Research Lab_ ##

The creation of inclusive spaces includes entities such as the Black History Research Lab, founded in 2021 by Dr. Sydney Freeman Jr., which was initially funded by the President’s Office and is currently funded by the History Department and the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences.[^167] The creation of the lab has been a tremendous effort undertaken at the University, allowing for stories of Black students and faculty to be brought forward and celebrated. The lab has been able to partner with the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning at the University of Idaho, which resulted in both the creation of a digital archive[^168] (for easier research purposes) and a physical exhibit that showcased some of the history to the community. This has allowed for a greater outreach on campus regarding race and has given a strong base from which new innovation can come forward for areas like Black faculty recruitment.

## _Africana Studies Program_ ##

The idea of highlighting African culture and African diaspora is further accomplished by the Africana Studies Program.[^169] This program was developed in 2016 by Drs. Kristin Haltiner, Romuald Afatchao, and Sydney Freeman Jr. (note that it was developed by professors and not by senior leadership), and has sought to teach students to understand the history behind much of contemporary politics and racial relations today. Even though the program is newer and has not yet seen many graduates, it plays a vital role in helping diversify and educate students on campus.

## _Black Administrators _ ##

As aforementioned, the 2000s were a time of growth for faculty of color on campus, especially Black faculty, as the University of Idaho presented a stronger outreach to farther and more diverse areas of the country. The first of many important faculty elected to a high position at the University was Mark A. Edwards, who in 2006 was hired as the first Black director for diversity and community.[^170] This hire was important for many reasons, but its biggest significance is that this position reported directly to the President’s Office, which means that Edwards was given a role with significant power at the University. His main role was to ensure the enrichment of educational programs through diversity and to help integrate a more diverse faculty. Thanks to his efforts and those of many others, many new Black and African faculty members have been hired throughout the years. 

Another big appointment was Michael Satz, the associate dean in the College of Law in 2012, to interim dean in the College of Law in 2013.[^171] Even though his appointment was only temporary, this is one of the highest positions held by a Black faculty member at the University of Idaho, and it shows that Black faculty are able to climb the  proverbial ranks of the system in place at the University. 

Additionally, Dr. Hassel Andre Morrison, a doctoral graduate from North Carolina, was hired as the associate dean of students in 2015.[^172] This important role allowed him to maintain a stable relationship with Black students and ensure that they were successful at the University. He maintained this position until 2018, when he was named Vice President for Student Life at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. 

This continued effort to diversify University faculty and staff can be seen in the employment of mid-level administrators, such as Raymond A. Dixon to the position of assistant professor at the University in 2011 and later to the department chair of Curriculum and Instruction in 2018.[^173]  He was the first Black tenured faculty member and the first Black administrator in the College of Education. 

Dr. Wudneh Admassu, a professor in chemical and biological engineering, was the first person of African descent to become a full professor at the University, in 2015, as part of the University of Idaho’s international recruitment program. For a period of time, Dr. Admassu also served as the chair of the Chemical and Materials Engineering Department. 

Dr. Romuald Afatchao began his journey at the University in 2001 by completing an English language program and then beginning the doctoral program in environmental science in 2003 and earning his PhD in 2009. He has since established himself quite strongly on campus, becoming a clinical full professor in 2014 and being appointed the associate director of the Martin Institute at the University of Idaho in 2009.[^174] The Martin Institute’s purpose statement is a “research and outreach center at the University of Idaho dedicated to understanding the causes of war, the conditions necessary for peace and the international system.”[^175]

## _Black Faculty_ ##

The list of Black faculty achievements continues from here, with the appointment of Lynda M. Freeman to the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho Medical School Program (WWAMI) at the University in 2016, becoming the first Black woman to do so.[^176]  This achievement is yet another that has set the precedent for the continued recruitment of Black faculty members and increasing the diversity of the campus. 

Professor Shaakirrah Sanders, a professor of law at the Boise campus College of Law was the first Black woman, and second person of color, to achieve the rank of full professor at the University of Idaho in 2018.[^177] However, there has been controversy regarding Professor Sanders as she filed a lawsuit against the University and the former dean of the College of Law, Mark Adams, in 2019, citing that racial and gender discrimination prevented her from being hired as the associate dean at the College of Law.[^178] This lawsuit is still ongoing. 

Dr. Sydney Freeman Jr. was hired in 2015 as an associate professor in the College of Education. He earned tenure in 2018 and was promoted to the rank of full professor in 2021. This made him the first African American man, who is a descendent of slaves, to be promoted to the rank of full professor at the University of Idaho.[^179] Dr. Freeman’s presence on campus has led to significant impacts in terms of promoting Black history and culture, with nearly every major Black initiative undertaken over the past four years having some trace of his involvement. 

Dr. Freeman has also undertaken many other academic initiatives by himself, with one of his first being undertaken shortly after his arrival at the University of Idaho. For context in the following issue, the College of Education (before 2005) considered many of its faculty members to be more teaching focused, rather than research focused.

However, this model changed after 2005, with research funds being given to newer faculty members to aid in their research. This change eventually resulted in these newer faculty members receiving promotions before other faculty members who had been at the College of Education much longer. Dr. Freeman sought out to rectify this issue with the department, eventually finding three faculty members who were deserving of elevation, two of those members becoming full professors and the other to soon become a department chair. 

Dr. Freeman developed a weekly virtual meeting titled “Freeman’s Virtual Research Lab,” which aimed at helping prepare graduate students for future research by getting those students to engage in writing research reports. The program has had great success, with four out of the five students advancing to earn their PhDs. This program acted as a precursor for a course called “Research Apprenticeship” at the University of Idaho, which has helped to impact doctoral students of all backgrounds, specifically in the fields of leadership and education study. He also was a leading advocating voice in preventing a departmental merge between the leadership and counseling departments. 

As seen with Dr. Freeman’s example, these hirings have been a major step in helping to better diversify the predominantly White campus of the University of Idaho and have played a major role in driving the University towards better educating the community surrounding it. The Black faculty at the University have come together and established the first Black and Faculty Association on campus, in 2022, something that had been on their agenda since as early as 2020.[^180] It should be noted that this process of establishment was undertaken mostly by the Black faculty and staff themselves, with not much outside support. The employment of more Black faculty at the campus highlights the University of Idaho’s desire to diversify itself and to bring new resources to bear in doing so, but there have also been issues in this regard.

# Future #

Black history at the University of Idaho spans all the way back to the early days of the school and has played a significant role at the University by diversifying the campus and pushing its academic standings. With the collective history of Black persons at the University now summed up, the question remains: What does the future look like for Black students and faculty at the University?  

As has been noted in the past, those active Black students and faculty at the University have accomplished much; however, there have been issues that have prevented them from going even further. Whether it be a lack of support from senior leadership or the inability to find a space to meet on campus, Black students and faculty at the University have struggled to push the racial bar to its current position. As such, the history of Blacks at the University relies heavily on two items: an active Black student and faculty body, and support from senior leadership at the University. 

The research at the University indicates that these two items are what have either promoted greater Black progress at the University or have stagnated it. These two items are interchangeable in the fact that if one does not have the support of the other, then no progress is bound to be made. With this preliminary knowledge, necessity dictates that the general university culture of the United States ought to also be examined, as the University of Idaho follows the patterns of many other universities. **As such, there are two main areas that need further investigation, the first being the Black student experience at universities and the second being the Black faculty, staff, and administrators’ experience at universities.**

## _Black Students_ ##

Observing the first of these areas, the Black student experience is one of the keystones of a university’s diversity and is the base level for the advancement of Black academia. As aforementioned, the University of Idaho has come a long way in regard to its student diversity on campus, with a greater number of Latino/Latinx, Asian, Native-American, international, and Black students on campus. Though this is an improvement, it is far from where the current Black student population should be. 

The issue of recruiting Black students to the University has been a constant issue since the 1960s, with most of the Black student recruitment being through the Athletics Department. Most of the Black students today are student-athletes for the University, enrolled under scholarships or more affordable student tuition costs. The Athletics Department has had a notable budget in recent years, reporting a total budget of $21 million in the 2019 fiscal year.[^181] The 2019 budget for sports suggests that the University places high value on its athletics programs, which in that same year ran a deficit of nearly $1.5 million. 

The University’s overall net budget for the 2019 fiscal year was around $472.5 million[^182] and maintained similar levels of funding in 2022 at around $471 million.[^183] This means that in 2019 alone, the University spent 22.5% of their entire budget on athletics, implying that the athletics program is heavily valued. These numbers are important, as they hold the statistical numbers of Black student-athletes at the University and help to better understand how Black student recruitment has been undertaken.

According to a report published by the National Center for Education Statistics in 2020, there has been a general increase of students of color aged 18-24 at colleges and universities across the nation. The report states that Black student enrollment rates increased from 31% in 2000 to 37% in 2018.[^184] Though this is impressive, the Black student population has remained very similar to its population in the early 2000s, percentage-wise, sitting at around 1.12%. 

Though this lack of growth makes sense for the North Idaho area, the University has taken other interests in smaller student of color groups over those of Black students. Bailey Guyette, the first researcher to publish her findings on Black history at the University with Dr. Freeman, noted in an article from the _Moscow-Pullman Daily News_, in 2020, that when the University noticed a Latino/Latinx presence was on campus, an effort was made to recruit and facilitate them, leading to them having several Greek houses currently on campus.[^185]  

The effort undertaken by the University in recruiting a greater Latino/Latinx student population on campus is further shown by its percentage growth, from 865 enrolled students in 2012 to 1,115 in 2021.[^186] Though this rate of increase is not massive, and though the Latino/Latinx student population still has small numbers on campus, their population comprises around 9.4% of the student population in comparison to the 1.12% Black student population. The larger percentage of Latino/Latinx students on campus makes sense as this number reflects the growing rate of the Hispanic community, which currently sits at 13% of the total state of Idaho’s population.[^187]  

Though these statistics better explain the numbers, this and comments made by former University of Idaho president Chuck Staben fully uncovers the University policy regarding diversifying the University of Idaho. In 2018, an article published by _Idaho Education News_  stated that “U of I President Chuck Staben said the university is committed to attracting a student body that looks like Idaho” (Kolodner 2018).[^188] Even though this is a rational argument for an Idaho university, especially one that has struggled with recruiting students of color, it also highlights the shortsightedness of university policy towards diversifying student populations. This mindset defines the notion that the University not further diversifying itself is an acceptable penalty of being located in North Idaho. While this is a more subtle move, it directly plays into the discrimination and systemic racism that Black students, and students of color in general, face in their pursuit of higher education. This mentality is what adversely affects the ability of a university to recruit and retain students of color as well as what seriously harms Black academia. 

There have been many studies published that record either discriminatory policies at universities or discrimination from individuals on/around campus grounds. According to a Pew Research Center survey in 2016, 81% of Blacks with at least some college experience have experienced some kind of discrimination.[^189] This higher level of discrimination has given rise to greater mental health issues within Black university student populations, who have a much harder time at predominantly White institutions and have less support from faculty.

A study published in 2004 by Chavous et al. found that 34% of Black students at predominantly White universities with small Black student populations admitted to changing their behavior more towards the more dominant White culture present.[^190] This idea is further supported by two studies, published in 2011[^191] and in 2013,[^192] dealing with _minority-status stress_ or “...unique stressors experienced by minority students, which may include experiences with racism and discrimination, insensitive comments, and questions of belonging on a college campus.”[^193] The two studies found that out of all minority/racial student groups, Black college students are more likely to experience these unique stressors and are more prone to suffer from it if attending a predominantly White university.

The struggles of having to deal with a feeling of not belonging at a predominantly White university is further amplified by the lack of support Black students feel from faculty. Though much older, a study from 2002 observed that Black students at predominantly White institutions felt that they did not receive much support from outside ethnic group cliques and from faculty.[^194] This observation still very much exists within modern higher education, where there is increased demand by Black students for Black programs led by Black faculty. In this area, the University of Idaho has done a better job in recent years, as mentioned with the installment of a Black Cultural Center and the hiring of Director Mario Pile in 2022, aimed at aiding in that task. 

Dealing with retention rates, the University of Idaho has continued to see development despite the effects of COVID on the higher education system. For example, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, in October of 2021, found that there was a decline of 22.3% of Black students in higher education institutions during the spring of 2021 in comparison to the spring of 2020.[^195] The University of Idaho reported around 122 Black students during the spring of 2020, maintaining the percentage rate of around 1%, indicating that despite COVID, the University managed to retain a majority of its Black student population.[^196] And the University has also reported that during the fall 2021 semester, it saw an increase of enrollment by 4.7%, which suggests that, at least at the University of Idaho, COVID is not as limiting as it was in 2020.[^197]  

However, another area that the University may see some issues in, with regard to Black students, is their budgeting. Black families per capita have one of the lowest family incomes in the US, at least 15% lower than that of White families in 2020.[^198] Black students from these Black families also have some of the highest student loan debts, having nearly $25,000 more loan debt than White students, or 6% more than they borrowed originally against the 10% less owed by White students.[^199] This student loan debt gap between Black and White students within the United States highlights an important issue that very well affects the University of Idaho, as many of the Black students are either on scholarships or student loans. When compared with the University’s average tuition cost of $8,304 for an undergraduate degree in 2020, these money issues definitely play a role in the University’s ability to recruit new Black students.[^200] With the money allocated currently, it seems that the Black student population size will remain at similar levels unless the University is willing to divert more funding towards diversifying its campus. 

## _Black Faculty, Staff, and Administration_ ##

Looking at the faculty situation at the University of Idaho, the University has seen a significant uptick in staff diversity since its original founding. For instance, in 2000 there were only 43 faculty of color out of 600 total faculty members,[^201] and since then, this number has increased to 1,211 staff of color out of 6,702 total staff members.[^202] Within these numbers, there were a reported 24 Black faculty members in 2021, a far cry from the one member (Dr. White) that had held a position in 1978. A journal article titled “The Black Academic: Faculty Status among African Americans in U.S. Higher Education,” published in 2000, noted that Black faculty members only comprised 4% of professors and associate professors in higher education, compared to White faculty members who comprised nearly 87% of all tenured faculty members.[^203] The percentage of Black faculty members with tenure increased to its highest in 2015 at 7.57% and has sat at this average in recent years, with White faculty members sitting at around 70-71%.[^204]  These numbers can be further broken down, with 6.1% of all Black faculty members being full-time in 2016[^205] and 4.33% being on tenure track at institutions in the United States.[^206] This increase does signify that there has been a larger recruitment of Black faculty members at universities in the United States, and despite the stagnation, the University of Idaho has grown its staff numbers (although not significantly). However, it also signifies that there are inherent issues with the higher education system in the United States.

The limited number of Black faculty promoted to full professor positions is an example of existing systemic/institutional racism within US academia. Looking at the tenure issue itself, there exist many issues with it, but the biggest issue is that there are not enough Black tenured faculty and those who have been granted the rank of full professor.

The first large issue is that tenured faculty at universities are predominantly White, which leads to issues with the “similar to me” bias or the bias in which someone compares someone else to themself and judges them accordingly.[^207] In a study published in 2012, it was observed that Black faculty members at predominantly White institutions found themselves unable to bond with tenured faculty because of this bias,[^208] which is further interconnects with other problematic views which have been observed over the years of racial stereotypes or biases. A study in 2006 found that many Black faculty members felt they had been overlooked by White tenured faculty for not sharing a similar research focus with their White counterparts, or for being perceived (by White counterparts) as not intelligent enough to work with them.[^209]  

Studies also found that a common bias among senior White faculty during the tenure process was that Black tenure-track faculty were being hired merely for the sake of affirmative action, rather than for their achievements within their respective fields.[^210] These issues are important within the tenure hiring process, as they lead to minority-status stress, which is experienced by Black students as well.

During their tenure process, many Black faculty members at predominantly White institutions noted the tenure process was more difficult for them than for other White faculty members,[^211] and they reported feelings of intimidation and of being on their own without support from senior faculty.[^212] At the University of Idaho, this does not seem as bad in comparison to other institutions, with at least five faculty members out of 12 (higher faculty) having tenure. Tenure is important as it allows for Black faculty to conduct research on topics of their choosing, such as Black history, at a university. In comparison, a study produced in 2007 found that only 7% of Black professors in the United States were tenured. This does imply that the University of Idaho has done a much better job within this category.

Continuing with the numbers of higher faculty members at the University of Idaho, out of those 12, five are full professors and three are associate professors. In 2016, the number of Black full professors sat at 3.8% and Black associate professors sat at 5.8% out of over 700,000 professors in the US higher education field.[^213] When comparing these numbers with those of the University of Idaho, more Black faculty have been able to get into these positions that are difficult for Blacks to achieve in general across the United States. Professorships and associate professorships have been continuously noted as positions harder to obtain by Blacks due to the lack of commitment towards hiring Blacks into junior faculty positions and in where the power lies at the university when hiring new professors. 

One such argument that has been made regarding the lack of Black hires is that there is a scarcity of Blacks in the PhD pipeline; however, numbers reported in a 2006 study noted that the 24 highest ranking liberal arts universities had Black professorships made up over 5% of overall faculty.[^214] These universities have also been recorded as having superior recruiting processes, thanks to a higher level of commitment towards diversifying their faculty. A more in-depth look at the difficulties for Black faculty advancement at universities, apart from racial biases and predominantly White councils, reveals that Black faculty members are “overburdened with teaching and service responsibilities” (Allen et al. 2000).[^215] Said another way, this articulates the point that many Black faculty at universities are not only teaching classes, but undertaking more responsibilities to support underrepresented students on campus. 

Research also shows that Black faculty members take on more mentoring, advising, and other service roles in support of these students, while additionally serving on minority issue committees and promoting diversity initiatives on their respective campuses.[^216] This can be seen at the University of Idaho, where several professors not only teach, but also serve on these minority committees or are working on projects aimed at diversifying the campus. And while the percentage of full and associate professors who are Black is impressive compared to the overall numbers of Black faculty, it ought to be recognized that most of those tenured were promoted within the last five years. 

On this topic, another prevalent issue that plagues the higher education system is the lack of Black women as full professors, associate professors, or tenured professors. In 2019, the _Chronicle of Higher Education _reported that only 2.1% of tenured full and associate professors identified as Black women.[^217] This issue is present due to several biases that exist within universities, including the tendency to belittle Black women’s achievements while at the same time demanding they do more. 

For example, tenure is heavily reliant on three areas of work: teaching, research, and service. The teaching area is heavily reliant on student evaluations, which studies have shown favor teachers who are both White and male.[^218] The research area of tenure is reliant upon faculty producing research articles discussing something in their field. Here it has been observed that Black women not only face more bias from publishers and editors, but articles published by women in general are cited  less frequently than those produced by men.[^219] This is further aggravated by unfair biases of publishers that force Black professors to publish articles in lesser known journals, like the _Journal of African American Males in Education_,_ _than their White counterparts. And finally, as aforementioned, Black faculty members in general dedicate more time towards helping underrepresented students, which is not as accurately depicted within their dossiers as it should be. 

The above example shows the difficulty Black women face when approaching tenure and sheds further light on other challenges that are present for them in full or associate professor positions. As such, the University of Idaho has hired Black women to faculty member positions, including tenured Associate Professor Rochelle Smith in the library and full Professor Shaakirrah Sanders at the Boise law school extension. The University has also made significant progress inthe hiring of Black women faculty, with Lynda Freeman being another Black woman hired to WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho joint medical education school) in 2016; Sanders was also named one of the Idaho Women of the Year in 2022.[^220]  

This shows that the University has, in recent years, made more active progress in crucial areas compared to other universities across the nation and has done a generally better job in its recruitment of Black women in the higher education field. However, this area is not issue-free for the University. For example, as previously mentioned, Professor Sanders has an active lawsuit against the University of Idaho for wrongfully passing her over for promotions due to her being a Black woman. This indicates that while the University of Idaho has certainly done a better job in this area, there are still kinks and biases within the system that need to be addressed. 

One more piece of valuable insight into the issues faced by Black academics is a research model proposed by Dr. Sydney Freeman Jr. This model directly examines Black academia reform at universities and is titled the “Model of Black Transformation.”[^221] The model is broken down into a five-step approach, and those five steps are: (1) Decolonization, (2) Abolition, (3) Revolution, (4) Liberation, and (5) Sovereignty. 

The first step, decolonization, as defined by Dr. Freeman, is “the holistic process of letting go of colonial practices, values, and culture.”[^222] In other words, this step seeks to turn Black faculty mindsets more towards studying Black history in the United States and abroad, focusing on research that directly impacts Black people. At the University of Idaho, this step has seen progress in the development of the Africana Studies Program and the Black History Research Lab, both of which are aimed at educating people of Black history at home and abroad. 

The second step of this model, abolition, is “being willing to fight injustice and dismantle practices, systems, institutions, or power structure” (Freeman 2021).[^223] This step directly confronts the issues that stem from systemic racism at universities and seeks to make the universities more engaged with Black academia promotion. At the University of Idaho, this step can be seen throughout the present Black history, with the BSU accomplishing much in the way of overturning negative policies, and the work of Black faculty in garnering higher positions at the University (though issues still persist within this area, as noted by the Sanders’ lawsuit). 

The third step is revolution, or the “fundamental change from the status quo that facilitates new ways of knowing, being, and operating.”[^224]  Put another way, this means that Black faculty will put the needs of themselves and their communities ahead of universities that do not appreciate them. Though the University of Idaho certainly does not fit into this catalog, the Black Faculty Association was officially established at the University in 2022 certainly would argue that the Black faculty have come together to focus on their own needs with regard to an area the University has not excelled in. 

The fourth step is liberation, defined as “free from forms of spiritual, psychological, and physical oppression and captivity.”[^225]  Liberation would allow for esoteric research to be done by Black faculty, allowing them to leave the heavily structured area of White research they have struggled with, and allowing them to pursue their own topics of interest. 

And the last step is sovereignty, or the commitment of Black faculty towards owning Black institutions and carving out spaces for Blacks on campuses.[^226] In this regard, the University of Idaho has seen this step somewhat accomplished with the establishment of the Black Cultural Center in 2022. 

This model is an important tool that helps visualize the progress of Black academia at universities and also assesses the promotion of Black academia at the University of Idaho. Reviewing the historical achievements of Black individuals at the University of Idaho, the progression of Black students and faculty, and the analysis of current trends within US universities, the picture of what the future for Black people at the University of Idaho will look like has become clearer. This research has shown that the University of Idaho has an exceptional amount of Black history on its campus and, in comparison to other US universities, has done a better job in diversifying itself despite its location in the state of Idaho, an area with a poor history of racial relations and limited diversity. As such, the future for Blacks at the University of Idaho looks quite promising in lieu of how far it has come and how much has been done towards promoting Black academia in recent years. 

It would be safe to say that Black academic excellence at the University will only increase in future years. However, this continued successful growth is dependent on two things: the continued, active presence of Black students and faculty at the University, and the continued support of senior leadership in the University’s higher ranks. If one or the other should falter, then presumably the University would see a stagnation of this growth, as is evident by past occurrences. As it currently stands, Black history at the University has the continued support of both these needed monumental pillars. Though the University of Idaho is not perfect in terms of strong diversification protocols or in supporting its Black faculty perfectly, and issues do certainly persist with University policies aimed at Black persons, the University has excelled in areas where other US universities (even Ivy League universities) have failed. Hence, it is easy to see that the University of Idaho serves as a small beacon of hope that Black academia in the United States can continue to improve and that at the University of Idaho, if both the aforementioned pillars are upheld, Black history can only continue to progress to newer heights. In 2023, Black history and Black excellence at the University of Idaho has never looked better in the school’s 131-year history, leaving only the promising prospect of continued Black academic growth in the North Idaho area.
