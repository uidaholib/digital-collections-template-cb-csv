## About the Collection

*This is a quickly built collection from the files of Earl Bennett. The University of Idaho Library will be building a more comprehensive database of all these newspaper issues in the future, but for now we wanted to get this material available in a simple format.*

This collection contains the Genesee News and predecessor newspapers, the Recorder and Advertiser, covering 80 years from the arrival of the railroad and the beginning of New Genesee, ID in 1888 to 1968 when the News was merged with the Kendrick Gazette. The stick contains a series of .pdf files (Adobe Acrobat), one for each year of the paper and this ReadMeGeneseeNews file.  The Adobe Acrobat reader is available as a free download from the Web. 

The digital files (.pdf) were compiled by scanning the microfilm of the papers prepared in the 1970s and ‘80s by the Idaho State Historical Society (ISHS).  The scanning was done by Integra Information Technologies, Inc., in Boise, ID using archival microfilms provided by the ISHS.  A Community Grant from the ISHS paid for the conversion.  

There is a separate .pdf  (Adobe Acrobat) file for each year and the files were indexed by the weekly date of the papers by Earl H. Bennett, Genesee City Historian.  Missing issues are also noted in the indices.  These data are available online via the University of Idaho Library, Moscow, ID.  The data on disk is available at the Genesee City Library, the Genesee High school library and Earl H. Bennett, City Historian, Genesee, ID. 

Of note is file 1898OCRSpecEd.pdf. This was an experimental issue that contains many pictures of Genesee people and places. Pictures in newspapers of this period were rare as it was difficult and expensive to print photographs.

### A Short History

The following paragraph of the early history of the Genesee News was abstracted from a paper by Keith Armstrong in 1934.  Mr. Armstrong had worked briefly for the News.  

*The first issue of the Genesee Advertiser was published on August 4,1888 with J.L.G Mays as editor.  It was a 6-column handset paper.  It followed quickly on the heels of the arrival of the Spokane and Palouse Railroad into New Genesee in April of that year.  By November the paper had changed hands with E. R. Wiswall in charge. Mr. Wiswall left for Spokane and the paper was under the care of  T. Barton by April 1889 and again had changed hands to C. C. Neal by October of that year.  The paper’s name was changed to the Genesee Recorder with C. M. Poor and R. W. Jenkins in charge by May 1891 with Mr., Poor taking over full control after just a few weeks.  By May of 1892, Charles Power and J. W. Hopp had taken over.  The paper became the Genesee News on June 17, 1892 and the size increased from six to seven columns.  It changed back to six columns and was enlarged to 8 pages on Oct. 5, 1894.  By 1895 an entire page was devoted to national and world news.  The first halftone appeared on January 17, 1901.  By 1902, Mr. Power was in charge of the paper.  On November 5, 1909, H. W. Brune was the owner as Mr. Power sold out and moved to Spokane.  P. C. McCreary took over on Jan. 3, 1913.    An interim director, Arthur H. Potsch managed the paper for a while in 1926 and E. D Pederson was the new owner by November 1928.*

Pederson would own the News until 1954 when the paper was purchased and published by William D. Roth, his wife, Jane and their son Bill. In August 1968 the Roths bought the Kendrick Gazette from William L. McCreary and announced that the Gazette and Genesee News would be merged under the banner of the Kendrick Gazette-News. William McCreary was the son of  P. C. McCreary who owned the News in 1913 and then moved to Kendrick to manage the Gazette. After William Roth died, his son Bill took over the paper.  He got out of the business for a while in 1985 selling the paper’s name and subscriber list to the Whitman-Latah Republic until that paper failed.  Bill restarted the Kendrick paper as the Gazette in 1987 and it finally closed for good in 1998.   


### Using the PDFs

The PDFs have built in bookmarks to provide an index to individual issues. After downloading a .pdf file for a particular year using Adobe Acrobat, open the index by clicking on the page icon with a bent corner and a blue bookmarker on the left-hand side of the page.  A drop-down index opens showing the date of each paper for that year.  Each file is indexed by date in the format- 6/15/1914 (June 15, 1914).  Missing issues are also noted.  Clicking on the index for a particular date takes you to that issue. To close the index, click the small arrow to the right in the box containing the word “Bookmarks.”   

To change the magnification of the document, click the arrow next to the + and – in the menu bar at the top of the document. 

To move from page to page, click on the arrows at the top and bottom of the column on the right side of the page.  Clicking in the white space in this column above or below the small box will also move the entire page up or down.  You can also move the page using the page up or down keys on the keyboard. 

If this file is opened using the free version of Adobe Reader then cutting and copying articles are not possible, but it is easily done with the full version of Adobe Acrobat. 

### Genesse News Copyright

Is there a valid copyright on the Genesee News? On January 3, 2011, I compiled the following information about the existence of a copyright.

In 1954 the Genesee News was purchased from E. D. Pederson by William D. Roth, his wife, Jane and their son Bill. In August 1968 the Roths purchased the Kendrick Gazette from William L. McCreary and announced that the Gazette and Genesee News would be merged under the banner of the Kendrick Gazette-News. William McCreary was the son of P. C. McCreary who owned the Genesee paper in 1913 and then moved to Kendrick to manage that paper. After William Roth died, his son Bill took over the Kendrick paper.  Bill got out of the business for a while selling the paper’s name and subscriber list to the Whitman-Latah Republic.  The Republic was merged into the Whitman-Latah Record in 1981 along with the Palouse Republic and Garfield Enterprise.  The Record became “The Boomerang” later in the 1980s (J.H. Publications, Inc.).  The Kendrick Gazette was restarted by Bill Roth in 1987 and this venture closed for good about 1998.   

I talked to Steve McMillian, ([buckdude@tds.net](mailto:buckdude@tds.net), 208-289-4656 in Kendrick) the last owner of the Kendrick print shop (purchased from Bill Roth in 1999).  He does not know of any copyright associated with the Genesee News and he does not hold one.  McMillian moved to Kendrick in 1998 to learn how to set lead type from Bill Roth. Mr. Roth became ill in 1998-1999 and the paper closed.  

According to Ann Catt, the Latah County Historical Society (LCHS) donated a 4-foot stack of flat-stored issues of the Genesee News to the Palouse Boomerang years ago. The plan was that the Boomerang would have them scanned by SmallTownPapers, Inc.  In a phone conversation with Lujean Nisse in Palouse (208-413-0153), the last owner of the Boomerang, some issues of the News were sent to be scanned (see Google  Archives and FootNote.com below), but she does not know what happened to the rest of them.  She suggested that they ended up with the Latah Eagle.  She does not believe that the Boomerang had any copyright on the Genesee News and if she owns it, she does not care if the papers are released to the public.  

In July 2009 the Latah Eagle merged with the Palouse Boomerang, under the name Eagle & Boomerang owned by J&H Publications, Inc. The Latah Eagle began in June 1998 with the purchase of the Kendrick Gazette. In February 2010, the Eagle & Boomerang ceased publication of a print copy and went totally online at [www.eagle-boomerang.com](http://www.eagle-boomerang.com/).

Mr. Kai Eiselein (cell-208-413-0153) last owner of the Eagle & Boomerang, does not know where the Genesee News papers that were sent to Palouse by LCHS are located.  He does not believe there was any copyright on the News.  

The website, FootNote.com; ([http://www.footnote.com/browsemore/32195055_Newspapers%5EUnited%20States%5EIdaho/](http://www.footnote.com/browsemore/32195055_Newspapers%5EUnited%20States%5EIdaho/))

has a few copies on line of the Genesee News from 1917,1920, 1939,1947,1948,1953 and 1954. 

Google Archives ([http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=sYWwZaPVD1oC) has](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=sYWwZaPVD1oC) has) several copies of the Genesee News available and information on how the data was acquired.   

Some issues of the Genesee News are available at_: _[SmallTownPapers - The Genesee News, Genesee Idaho](http://smalltownpapers.com/newspapers/newspaper.php?id=141)
