## About the Collection

The *Other Faces, Other Lives: Asian Americans in Idaho* video project includes interviews of eight Asian-American families, specifically Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino, on their lives and experiences in Idaho. The project was sponsored by the Palouse Asian American Association of Moscow/Pullman and a grant from the Ethnic Heritage Committee of the Idaho Centennial Commission. The interviews cover how their families moved to Idaho, their experiences of being Asian-Americans in Idaho, if they faced discrimination or prejudice, questions regarding their cultural identities, and changes they see to the Asian-American experience in Idaho. The project resulted in the publication and release of the film *Other Faces, Other Lives: Asian Americans in Idaho" on VHS and local broadcasting programs.
