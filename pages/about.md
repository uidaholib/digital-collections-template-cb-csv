## About The Collection

Originally produced in 1991, the Hispanic Oral History Project consists of 22 interviews of Hispanic immigrants and descendants who lived in Idaho. The project was sponsored by the Idaho Humanities Council, the Ethnic Heritage Committee of the Idaho Centennial Commission, and the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs. The interviews from this collection resulted in the publication of the book *Voces hispanas = Hispanic voices of Idaho*. The interviews include topics on the Mexican-American and Hispanic-American experience of the interviewees in Idaho, family life, racial discrimination, farming, life during the depression, and education.

## About The Project

Support for this digitization project was provided by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) through the Recordings at Risk program. The University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives received a grant through this program to support the project *Unheard Voices: Digitizing the Oral Histories of Underrepresented Communities in Idaho.* We chose three collections that contained audio or video recordings of oral history interviews: [MG 68 Rural Women's History Project](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv42414/), [MG 390 Lily Wai Committee Papers](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv54043/), and [MG 491 Hispanic Oral History Project Interviews](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv327325/).

These interviews offer a unique and important perspective on the experiences of minority communities living in a predominantly white and rural state throughout the 20th century. This digitization project will allow these voices to speak to us again. Included are 201 hours of first-hand oral history interviews, conducted between 1975 and 1990, that document the experiences of Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Hispanic Americans, Japanese Americans, and rural women living in Idaho in the 20th century.
