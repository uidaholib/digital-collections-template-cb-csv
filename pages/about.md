## About The Collection

The Hispanic Oral History Project consists of 22 interviews of Hispanic immigrants and descendants who lived in Idaho. The project was sponsored by the Idaho Humanities Council, the Ethnic Heritage Committee of the Idaho Centennial Commission, and the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs. The interviews from this collection resulted in the publication of the book *Voces hispanas = Hispanic voices of Idaho*. The interviews include topics on the Mexican-American and Hispanic-American experience of the interviewees in Idaho, family life, racial discrimination, farming, life during the depression, and education.
