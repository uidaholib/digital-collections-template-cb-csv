## About the Collection

The Rural Women's History Project was a project sponsored by the University of Idaho Women's Center designed to give insight on the experiences of women in rural communities in Northern Idaho. The project was funded by a grant from the Association for the Humanities in Idaho in the Fall of 1974. 

Over 100 interviews were conducted between 1975 and 1980 and included women from multiple age groups. Each woman was asked a variety of questions ranging from their upbringing, family life, marriage, citizen participation, and more.

In addition to their interview, each woman was photographed. The project identified changes in rural women's roles and how those changes affected their families and communities. Multiple presentations were given about the project in over 20 communities in Latah, Benewah, Clearwater, Nezperce, and Shoshone counties in Northern Idaho.

## About the Project

Support for this digitization project was provided by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) through the Recordings at Risk program. The University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives received a grant through this program to support the project *Unheard Voices: Digitizing the Oral Histories of Underrepresented Communities in Idaho.* 

We chose three archival collections that contained audio or video recordings of oral history interviews: [MG 68 Rural Women's History Project](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv42414/), [MG 390 Lily Wai Committee Papers](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv54043/), and [MG 491 Hispanic Oral History Project Interviews](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv327325/). The digitized materials from these collections can be found in the corresponding digital collections: 

- [Rural Women's History Project](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/rwhp/): Interviews with rural women in Latah, Benewah, Clearwater, Nez Perce, and Shoshone counties, Idaho, concerning the changing roles of rural women.
- [Other Faces, Other Lives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/otherfaces/): Interviews from the video project, *Other Faces, Other Lives: Asian Americans in Idaho* of eight 
Asian-American families about their experiences living, working, and raising a family in Idaho.
- [Hispanic Oral History Project Interviews](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/hohp/): 22 interviews of Hispanic immigrants and descendants who lived in Idaho.

These interviews offer a unique and important perspective on the experiences of minority communities living in a predominantly white and rural state throughout the 20th century. 

This digitization project will allow these voices to speak to us again. Included are 201 hours of first-hand oral history interviews, conducted between 1975 and 1990, that document the experiences of Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Hispanic Americans, Japanese Americans, and rural women living in Idaho in the 20th century.
