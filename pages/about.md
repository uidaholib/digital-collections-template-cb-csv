## About the Collection

The *Other Faces, Other Lives: Asian Americans in Idaho* video project includes interviews of eight Asian-American families, specifically Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino, on their lives and experiences in Idaho. The project was sponsored by the Palouse Asian American Association of Moscow/Pullman and a grant from the Ethnic Heritage Committee of the Idaho Centennial Commission. The interviews cover how their families moved to Idaho, their experiences of being Asian-Americans in Idaho, if they faced discrimination or prejudice, questions regarding their cultural identities, and changes they see to the Asian-American experience in Idaho. The project resulted in the publication and release of the film *Other Faces, Other Lives: Asian Americans in Idaho" on VHS and local broadcasting programs. 

This collection of oral history videos is found within the Lily Wai Committee Papers, MG 390. For many years, Wai worked as a librarian and Head of Government Documents at the University of Idaho Library, and was active in many university and state committees, including serving as project administrator for the Palouse Asian American Association to produce the *Other Faces, Other Lives: Asian Americans in Idaho* project. 

## About the Project

Support for this digitization project was provided by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) through the Recordings at Risk program. The University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives received a grant through this program to support the project *Unheard Voices: Digitizing the Oral Histories of Underrepresented Communities in Idaho.* We chose three collections that contained audio or video recordings of oral history interviews: [MG 68 Rural Women's History Project](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv42414/), [MG 390 Lily Wai Committee Papers](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv54043/), and [MG 491 Hispanic Oral History Project Interviews](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv327325/).

These interviews offer a unique and important perspective on the experiences of minority communities living in a predominantly white and rural state throughout the 20th century. This digitization project will allow these voices to speak to us again. Included are 201 hours of first-hand oral history interviews, conducted between 1975 and 1990, that document the experiences of Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Hispanic Americans, Japanese Americans, and rural women living in Idaho in the 20th century.
