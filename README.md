Black History @ the University of Idaho is an ongoing collaboration between the Black History Research Lab and the University of Idaho Library that examines the history and contribution of Black students, faculty, staff, and administrators at the University of Idaho.
Directed by Dr. Sydney Freeman Jr., this digital exhibit space and the regular physical exhibits that accompany and enhance the project seek to uncover untold histories and highlight the accomplishments of Black individuals on campus.
