# CollectionBuilder-CSV-compound-Template

<https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/>

A highly customized version of [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv) used to generate University of Idaho Library Digital Collections that contain compound objects.

The main branch represents our base collection template.
Additional branches contain a variety of individual collections with customized metadata and features.
Updates to the main branch can be merged into the collection branches to maintain the centralized template.

This repository is specifically for building U of I Library projects and trails behind development of the general [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv) template.

## CollectionBuilder 

<https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
