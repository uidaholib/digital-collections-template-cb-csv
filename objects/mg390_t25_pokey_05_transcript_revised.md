He always encouraged me. Like he always encouraged me when, in anything I did. I mean, you know,  he was good that way. My mother, she was a little skeptical. And then some friends of ours, you know,  he says to Japanese people, they work kind of against that I know this one fellow was quite an  educated fellow and he would come over all the time he, he thought I should quit dancing because  that's when I was studying and everything because he felt that that was entertaining for me, you know,  like the geishas and that's the idea that he has seen and he didn't like that very well.  
Okay. 

00:51 
Okay, what does it mean to you to you to be Japanese American? 

00:53 
What does it mean to me? Huh. To think, to think about it now I'd say I don't think anything about it.  Whether I was born another race or anything. It's got to that point but years ago, I used to say why me?  You know, when you’re in misery, but that's all gone now. I don't, only time I say “why me” is when I get  sick. But outside of that, I don't feel any different than me whether I'm Japanese American. I don't even  give it a thought that I did before. I don't anymore. See. So it shows you how much time has changed. I  don't think Huey ever give that a thought that he doesn't know. He just lived during the time that  everything's equal now. 

01:47 
So why don't you introduce us to your grandchildren here? 

01:51

02:19 
Are all of these years over here? 
Yes. 
All these trophies? 

02:23 
And I am in third grade. I am eight years old, (unintelligible) school. And I have won the speech festival  twice in a row. taking first place, second, twice against the eighth graders. Kindergarten through eighth  graders, I have taken a first and the first and a third.  
And I'm an orange belt in karate.  
And do you take dancing? 
Dancing, dancing. 
Do you learn from your grandmother? 
No. I take it from Debby Eisley. And I take gymnastics. 

03:16 
Who are your friends? 

03:19 
I have one friend who lives down the street. I have one friend who is in Butte, Montana. I have another  friend who is here, but she used to live in Ohio. Then I have another friend who is my karate teacher.  And he lives over in Bert Perusing apartments. Number five. Number five or seven? 

03:48 
How about you Julian? 

03:51 
How about you Julia? 
I don't know much about karate.

03:55 
Who are you friends? 
Oh. 

03:58 
One’s name is Adam. Well, I don't know where he is. One’s named Joey, he’s home. Kristen, Erin… 

04:16 
I don't know much else.. 

04:18 
I understand that there's a Japanese community around here. Do you have much contact with the  Japanese community? 

04:24 
Well, there's a JCL. You've heard about that haven’t you? Japanese American Citizens League, and it's  the Pocatello, Blackfoot chapter. And I think that it consists of about, maybe 40 families. 

04:40 
Do you have many functions that you've attended? 

04:44 
Well, not very many. They have a salmon bake every about August. They usually have a picnic in June.  And they meet once in a while, but usually when they meet it's like the, for funerals, and weddings, and  a lot of times they use the Japanese Hall to have their receptions. And all the women pitch in and make  the food, good food, sushi and all the good stuff. 

05:16 
You know, it might be interesting to ask the children how they perceive their role as far as traditional or  non traditional, and their acceptance and whatever. Yeah. 

05:27 
Yes, I do. 
Do they accept you? 
And well, I just started a new Japanese just called, Kendo?  
Kenjutso. 
Kenjutso. And they accepted me in there in kenjutsu. And that is a very hard style that takes the blood  and the Spirit and the power and the time and effort to do it. 

05:58 
Richard, do you do you learn anything from being Japanese? 

06:03 
Yes, I do. I learn the spirit of my great grandfather, and the sword and the staff, and have all sorts of  different weapons 

06:16 
Interested in weapons? 

06:19 
Do you speak Japanese? 

06:21 
Only a little bit in practice in that in a long time, but I know I can count to 99 in Japanese. 

06:39 
Can you say the alphabet? 

06:42 
Julia’s last year’s speech included the Japanese alphabet. And she took an honorable mention two  years in a row. And she started when she was three years old. 

06:54 
Excuse me. I think I might remember part of it. Okay, (recites Japanese alphabet). 
And I? Well, my, I know that a lot of people at my school like me, but they always know that I'm there  for them when they need me. 

07:29 
Do they know that you're half Japanese?  
No? 
No, I don't tell them. 
Do any of the kids that you play with, give you trouble because you half Japanese? 

07:43 
No, but there's one kid who did when I was at my local school. 

07:49
But that wasn't because you were Japanese. Just because you're…. 

07:55 
I was only three years old! 
How about you, Richard?  
No, not really. I haven't had any troubles with my friends, except the one down in street. 

08:07 
In fact, do you think, do you feel that being Japanese has has opened any doors for you? 

08:13 
A lot of, a lot of experiences that I might have not had if I was full American? 

08:23 
You know, for example, do they accept everyone into kenjutsu?  

08:31 
No. Because some of them may have, may be the high ranking student or may have the power but they  might not have the Spirit of the blood. Just like shekudo, they accepted me and I'm one of the lowest  ranking students. And they didn't and they and they don't know if they're going to accept the highest  ranking student. 

08:58 
What does he mean by lowest ranking student? 

09:00 
The lowest of the low, one of the lower belts versus the higher belts. Do you know why you were being  taught kenjutsu with the bow? The bow staff and the sword? 
No. 
Have there been very few other people have been accepted? 

09:15 
Because of you and because I'm half Japanese, 

09:19 
Is it because of the sword?  
No. 
What is it?

09:23 
My blood and my spirit. 

09:29
