My name is

Miko, and stay tuned 

00:39 
what 

00:41 
I tell you guys make wonderful subjects. 

00:46 
You know, when you ask a question you might go back to 

00:49 
start with her question. 

00:53 
Or even before because grandpa Lee evidently did the same thing. 

00:57 
Coordinate Cora, you know as far as that first question, first question 

01:04 
let's turn it on we 

01:10 
got a signal see in here? 

01:14 
What was the first question?

01:17 
That's the first Michael, 

01:19 
what were you referring to when you said first question? Oh, you know, what do we do to? 

01:26 
Yes. What do you do 

01:29 
that start with moving? 

01:32 
Okay, how did how did you add my ratio family to keep the Chinese culture going?

01:42 
Well, I live in the context of Idaho, in the context of Idaho 

01:51 
don't know very much about the context. 

01:56 
I'm sorry, I see you out there. I really just want How did you raise your children to ensure that they  learned something about the Chinese culture? 

02:06 
Well, for one thing, we do take them to visit some Chinese, Chinese parents in different cities. We go to  Seattle, and I have 

02:19 
two nephews and watch their family there. And then in Spokane, we have some very good friends that  we have known for 65 years I have known for 65 years. And of course, 

02:35 
Mike and I were married in 31. And he has known him too. We still have good friends here. And then, in  Walla Walla, we, we take them take our children at a time to visit many Chinese gardens. There are  many Oh, I imagine there are about five or six gardens there and voila, while the rest are noon and  Spanish, different Chinese vegetables too. And we take them, you know, on our vacations, or we take  them to to visit our Chinese friends, 

03:12 
Chinatown and to visit Chinatown. Well, in every city, we go naturally, where we will look up the  Chinatown first. In the first place, we have to eat you know, when when were visiting other cities, and that's why we go to booths. And we like in the old days, we like San Francisco Chinatown very well,  very much. But 

03:39 
last few years while we enjoyed the the Chinatown in Vancouver, BC because it's a little bit closer to us  in Moscow. So you expose them to the Chinese culture. Yes. Do you ever sit down and teach them?  Well, we tried to we tried to 

04:00 
when they were younger, we try to teach them Chinese characters. Although 

04:06 
we don't know too much about it, because I came over here to the United States in ninth in 1920 when I  was 10 years old, and my husband came was his father. They settled in Walla Walla. His father has the  restaurant there. And then cause

04:26 
he started school there and then finished high school at Walla Walla and then he came over to  Washington State and they went to college there. Did they get any formal instruction in the Chinese  language? 

04:40 
My children No, no. We try to but then there were no Chinese school here. And well, one when my  father came back from mainland China in 1962. 

04:54 
He tried to to 

04:57 
teach one to two 

05:00 
read Chinese and sing Chinese, 

05:03 
the church hymns, but they were not interested in too much. So he didn't get too far. Okay, I think in the  olden days, you know, my mom's generation, I think one of the things that they really did was trying to  get their kids to go back to China for so many years. In other words, they go back when they were they  were younger. Yeah, when they were younger, like seventh eighth grade, or maybe even in high school  for a year or two of Chinese education. Okay. And for us, I mean, when when mom and dad were  raising us, actually, probably we, we went to Chinese, like weddings and birthday parties and first  month, part of it in other sand, you know, even some Chinese funerals? Well, not traditionally, Chinese,  but as Chinese, Chinese funeral, loosen? Right, that's true, I have quite a few. But

05:56 
now, as far as we're concerned, I mean, each of us had our Chinese names, and that's about, you  know, we know him, but I don't even know we can write them. You know, now Leonard, at least can  write it because he's a little older group. So he can. But now, as far as we're concerned, I have to make  a concerted effort to, you know, to 

06:19 
make sure my kids have some Chinese tradition. Okay. All right. Well, first of all, when we were  growing up, Mom and Dad used to have parties, where they invite the Chinese students from wazoo  and University of Idaho and lots of the professors and their children. And we belong to the Chinese  organization, when I was going to college and mom and dad were, you know, would always donate  some, you know, 

06:45 
and also the Cosmopolitan, right, right up to when I was in at college. 

06:52 
But now with us, for First of all, I tried, I gave my kids Chinese names, just because I have no clue. And  I made the grandparents pick Chinese names. They're supposedly, in the male family with every family  name, there's supposed to be. 

07:09 
And each word of the poem indicates a generation. And so every, for example, in my brother, they're all  he's he right? He, I came along and his son, okay, and I'm not pronouncing this correctly. So, okay. But  and so that they knew then that was the heat generation, all of our cousins, you know, of the boy  cousins are all same general. He's in the loo family anyway. And then, so I thought, well, maybe there  was this type of thing and in children. And so I tried to get Pava chin to name Michael, that word of the  poem that would do it. While he was coming up with words like Bach, bong, and, you know, 

07:51 
this was from from 

07:54 
Yeah, far back. 

07:57 
Or whatever it is, I mean, just, you know, crazy toy I gave up, you know, I just, I asked Mother chin and  to give us some Chinese names. So I did try with a Chinese name part. And I did try and have my kids  go to Chinese school, which was absolutely. 

08:12 
Right. You know, it was just a real rough experience, not only for the kids, but for us. Because it's  Chinese school. Well, we had, you know, some Chinese students here. In fact, Connie, I think you've  taught it for a while. And she taught and they really tried to teach the kids but where they weren't getting any reinforcement from us at home. His family speaks haka. My family speaks some sort of  Cantonese, and it's called Kenya. And we can barely, I mean, we couldn't even get to the bathroom. If  we had to, you know, in Chinese. I mean, that's that bad. Okay. So they weren't getting any thing at  home for us. And so they would go there. And it would just be like that little block, you know, at school,  and they'd come home, they'd have nothing. And they were feeling frustrated. The other kids in the  class, were feeling frustrated, the teachers were feeling frustrated, the parents of the other kids were  feeling you know, it was just awful. It was just so fine. Now, let them go on that. I did take my children,  the two older girls to China. For a month, we, and we went to you know, we went into Mainland China  for 20 Some days, and we were in Hong Kong and in Taiwan, and I did that on purpose, so that they  would have, you know, an identification so they could feel their roots. And that was my first trip over  there. And like Dennis said, in his letter 

09:28 
that he said, I was just so thankful that, you know, my grandparents, both mom's parents, mom's dad  and also grandpa Lou had the foresight to leave China and to give us the opportunities that we had,  you know, for being Americans. It was just, I mean, it was just unreal. I just could not have imagined  myself growing up in in China. I mean, it was so awful I was and yet I could see my grandfather's  foresight, I really, I went to his grave sigh 

10:00 
And I went to the three buildings that he still owns in China that have been given back by the Chinese  government to the families that want to take it over. And I could see what an intelligent man he was,  from the, from where he picked each of the buildings, you know, in the town. I mean, what happens  right there by the police station is still there. And, you know, in the busiest sections of town, so there  was always rented there was always business there, you know, it wasn't, I mean, here it is, I don't  know, 40, some 50 years, you know, from the time when he first turned 

10:29 
6076 or 70 years, and it still in a real going part of Canton. I mean, it was really unique to me, but still,  I'm grateful for the fact that we're, you know, we're here, I have a question for you. 

10:46 
How do you feel about the Chinese culture to the traditional cultural not necessarily being passed?  down the generations? How do you feel about that? 

10:58 
How did I feel about the culture that the fact that they are not getting the culture that you know, you  guys had? And my father and mother didn't have your parents had? Michelle and Michael will not have  that part of the Chinese? Oh, well, for in the first place. They lived in China for so many years before  they came over? And poor periodically, we go back there to China to visit? And how do you feel about  them losing their culture? How do you feel about the fact that Tony, and Michelle and and Jenna some  of these kids when I think any, anything that 

11:42
you don't get it, you're losing? You know, I mean, 

11:48 
like my grandchildren, 

11:50 
of course, at this point, or they have no chance to going back to doing too much traveling or visiting  back in China. But 

11:59 
eventually, when when they are a little bit older, like if they have a chance to go go back to China to  visit, I think that would be a good idea. That's very, that's a part of learning that the younger generation  should get. And not only for, for my grandchildren and in the future. Great question. But I think  everybody in this world if they get a chance to they should go to other countries to visit to the only thing  is Mommy, so you were not one that pushed that dad was the one that pushed us. I go right behind  him. Well, yeah, but the thing is, for example, when we were not planning on going to try and what we  did, in fact, was that the year the year that a mom's 50th anniversary, no, no. 

12:46 
Yes, right. Okay. And dad was the one that just said, you're gonna you're gonna go and you're gonna  take the two kids. And I think we had Michael at that time to deploy. 

12:56 
Right, and they they volunteered to take care of the kids because they want to get younger workers.  And they wanted to expose the kids I mean, dad wanted us if he gave us no choice he's said I'll go on  buy the tickets you're going to send you're gonna go to China period. And so there was no choice in  that matter. How did you feel about oh, I had first when you father brought up the idea Well, I had never  thought about it. And 

13:24 
and yet you know, I had always listened to the you know, the stories about what happened the great  wall but how he felt when he walked the Great Wall for the first time. And going back to what he had  really wanted to go back to his village and and was born you know, and all these things and after he  came back, it really made me kind of think about it but still as far as my wanting to spend my money to do that at that time, and that wasn't a priority until Dad just said you're going period and when dad says  you're going you're going to do we did I mean, I mean he's bought he's bought us things and he said  well you're gonna buy this we buy it you know whether or not we're ready to buy it or we intend to buy it  you're buying it you're gonna do it just like you know for example, you know, like with one of the houses  you know, he just said you're gonna buy this house for me and I had to buy it. He said You know, he  bought this piece of ivory and he says you're gonna buy this Claire and so I buy it you know without  saying a thing he just tells me we're gonna do it we do it and 

14:22
so but I actually want to do it not because I didn't add I don't think that you were you were forced is  nothing tonight would have done well that's what you want to do. Not because yet not I wouldn't have  bought any I know you want to know much about it. But those are the things that that he had black he  feels that you can afford to buy and NSA a good investment. And so you buy it Yeah, you complied.  Yeah. Hard because of respect. Oh, yeah. Right degree because of that. Going back to 

15:00 
The way you're raising your children 

15:03 
and teaching them, the Chinese culture helping them to learn about the Chinese culture. 

15:10 
When you were speaking about that Chinese school was strictly a language school and essentially,  right. And they did teach them to do a little of the writing. And maybe to read, you know, just kind of  explained a little bit how the words are formed and that type of thing, but, but my kids, like I said, 

15:29 
didn't do all that well in it. Well, I'm curious, excuse me rehab, curious how the children felt about 

15:36 
being asked to attend the Chinese school. How did you feel about? Well, no one's really, really excited  about going to piano lessons and practicing a lot. And no one's really excited about learning a foreign  language. And that means you have to do homework, right? So that's, that's going to turn you off right  away. But it was really, really difficult because 

16:01 
there was nobody that we could ask help for. I mean, we could go to class and everything, but we were  kind of embarrassed or shy to, to really speak up. Because we didn't do our homework because we  didn't understand what we were writing. We just knew the these were lines on the paper, and that it  goes downwards, and it doesn't go across, like we usually do. And then she would, we would she  would sit there and she goes, Okay, read the story out loud. And I would sit there. I 

16:32 
totally speechless, you wouldn't know what to do, you would just kind of go well, I didn't do my  homework. And all the kids would look at you and you go, you didn't do your homework. Yeah. So it is. But otherwise, that's it was, it was a good experience, I guess, if you really look back on it, but at that  time, it was really, really hard. Very difficult. Would you generalize 

16:57 
that to the other Chinese experiences that your parents expose you to or take into? Or make you a part of? 

17:07
It? It's 

17:09 
just something 

17:12 
to broaden my, 

17:14 
my outlook on life, 

17:16 
too. You know, I mean, if you want to talk about things with people like, oh, well, what do you think of? 

17:24 
Nuclear War, something like that? I mean, it kind of brings out more of an interest for you. When you're  having conversations with others, like 

17:35 
the fact that you know more about your cultural background, seeing the the Chinese movies or going to the meetings. 

17:46 
camping with the other kids from the meeting? 

17:51 
Yeah, it helps me it helps to know that, you know, there are others out there. who speak Chinese. No. 

18:00 
No, except for grammar. Yeah. I guess I'm the only one let's keep up with my Chinese. 

18:08 
Well, I don't like I said, you know, I've had to make this real effort to do this. So anytime anything  oriental comes through, they have to go and see it plays, you know, right.

18:19 
acrobatic groups, I made them attend in, in Honolulu, this summer, they had to go to the the puppet  show, they were planning on going to several Chinese movies, you know, from dimsum, to there was a  whole group of more than because they're having their centennial or Bicentennial right over there. And I  just, I look for these things to come up. And they are kind of fighting me right now. Because I've told  them they are going to Taiwan, you know, on that exchange program for overseas Chinese. And I  thought that I was gonna be able to send the two girls over at once. And that's how come I was waiting  for Debbie to get into college because you at least in all,

18:58 
Mary and I didn't get to do this. But it was right after us that all the other of my brothers and sisters went  in fact we were the ones that kind of brought it up to the you know, like the one kids I think went in they  in the sons No, Huang's went and then the chance Off they go just because we kind of we kind of  brought this up to them and let them know that it was available and that we had you know the ones  have gone had really had a good experience, you know with it. And so I've already told my kids you're  gonna go well now I found out they only take one from each family each year. So now Susie's gonna go  you know, and I'm so I'm giving her a forewarning, you know, for a year or so that she's going to be  heading out there for that experience. And again, they have like Wazoo offered this 

19:45 
program in mainland China being you can get credit at one zoo and one of the professor's over there as  the ones doing and I will send my kids I will make that effort. I will put out that money. So they will have  that experience in all of them. 

19:58 
Is Leonard Leonard. Are you 

20:00 
All together in all of these attempts to teach the Chinese culture, well, not quite as 

20:09 
not quite as strong as she is. 

20:13 
I kind of think when these kids took Chinese lessons, you know, what am I not learn much Chinese. But  I know it's tough, at least we're associating with 

20:21 
kids from different professors and different families. And I thought it was a good, good way to make  good friends and lasting too, and they still do business, hustler friends around. 

20:31 
That's a good benefit by reading the stories, or her telling us what the stories were. We understood how  they thought and how 

20:43 
our culture, our culture, through those stories, I, I learned the culture of our background and stuff. That was really good. 

20:52 
Going to China, it was really different, though. 

20:56
I mean, I felt like I was a tourist, even though I was one of them, you know, I was a Chinese, just like  anybody else was there. But yet, everybody was wearing white shirts and black pants and riding  bicycles. And I just, I didn't feel like I was really a part of them. Really, you know, even though I was the  same. So that was but it was good. Because I, I saw the that we we were, we had a Qin dynasty. And  so I was really excited about that. And 

21:30 
I just saw a lot of Chinese and we never on the wasn't on the Imperial, you know, they have all those  little models. Yeah, it was it was a summer palace. The other three trips at my husband, I went to  mainland China. 

21:47 
We were one of the 300 Americans that were allowed into Mainland China in 1972, after Nixon got  open up the door. And we were very, very lucky. One of the reasons was that we had been a good  family, and we have five children's that we're leaving here, at home in Moscow, and just my husband  and I went there 

22:17 
to be able to get there, with a little boy appreciative that they that the American government, let us go  and the Chinese government lets us come in. But we had to answer many questions of what our  background is, and 

22:35 
and if we had ever been criminals, or anything like that, which we could answer in the right way that  we've never done anything that 

22:45 
was wrong, as far as we know. And then one. Another reason was that my husband's mother was 99  years old at that time. And he hasn't seen his mother since 1931. When he came back over here when  we got married. And we get to visit with her and she was just as active as she can be. And can see very  well and and can eat well and see well and hear well. But for for two years. Prior to that, though, she  had kind of lost her memory at 99 years, I guess you could expect that to be about normal. And, 

23:27 
but right after we saw her, she passed away about three months afterwards. So it just seems to us that  he she was just waiting to see my husband again, you know, before her life is

23:43 
cut in. And we were really glad that that was the first time I saw my mother in law 

23:51 
ever since even though we have been married since 31. I 

23:57
after we were married, we did not have the money to go back to visit China. 

24:04 
At first because we were very poor and still working the restaurant everything. And then one one, we do  have enough money that we could afford to go back when the Chinese people were close to the door  so we could not go back there until 1972. And then in 1978 and 1979 We went with a torch groups and  in somebody somebody ate, we have a Chinese Mei Mei Li family reunion there. My sister and brother,  brother in law from Hawaii and my brother and his wife from Albuquerque and 

24:45 
Maya and I from here, and the only one we miss is my sister Shani and her husband from Australia.  The reason why they could not 

24:56 
join us was because 

24:59 
the 

25:00 
Australian 

25:02 
government had already allowed them to go with another group into Mainland China. So, but we had a  very good time there with the we visited the, the hospital in, in Shanghai, because my sister and brother  in law are doctors. And so we join in with them. And then we went with that with people that are in  agriculture. And so we get to see that, you know, and then we, and one of the really interesting things  that they want to show to the tours is the school children, a system that they work on, all the school  children have, have worked one uniform. So even though a person from a poor family, they would he  would be dressed as well, as a student from a rich family. I think that is a very good idea. 

26:00 
In all of your travels, 

26:04 
in particular, in China, were people aware that you were from Idaho? Yes, we want to make sure that  we're from Moscow, Idaho, and not from Russia. And 

26:20 
we are and they, 

26:23 
well, we're more or less tours to, like,

26:27 
Debbie say, you know, of course, we still will be wearing our dresses and slacks, you know, and why  the others, the mainland, people wear their uniforms. But everywhere we went, we were very welcome.  Because they were bringing in money, you know, for the tourists. 

26:49 
From the former United States or from other countries, they were very glad to, to, 

26:56 
to entertain us. And we were given the best 

27:02 
hotel rooms. And even when we crossed the border from 

27:08 
from 

27:11 
not Hong Kong, but into into the mainland. The way a search, you know, and aware you have to 

27:20 
one thing about it is that the woman do it with a job just as much as the man. They that for one thing, I  like that, you know, because I'm being a woman, I want to be on the level with a man too. And so, 

27:36 
but the United States people, we have a special room that just the two of us go into and the 

27:45 
immigration officers just ask the tours in our private room, are they other people even from Europe, they all go through? Outside? 

27:59 
Big Room, you know, and we will serve hot tea and ask very nice questions, because we answered the  best way we can. 

28:09 
We can do, we can. And when we come out, we can only we do not, we cannot bring any Chinese  money back with us. So at the border, they would have little trinkets, you know, you want to spend your  loose change on buy something or you can just spend all your Chinese money. When you go into  China, you have to pack their money with a US currency, or to unite. That's one thing I noticed,  because we went with the Canadian group in this was even nine years ago. And we as American  citizens were treated different, much better than the Canadians and anybody else related to this  question you you're very well traveled as a family or as a plan. Do you can you tell if there's a difference  between

29:03 
a difference between being a Chinese and Idaho or the Chinese in Vancouver, in Canada or other  places that you know, too much difference? 

29:19 
how other people were they act toward us? Now, we've always said, well, most of the time we travel 

29:28 
in a group, which was nice, but some of that time we traveled by ourself. Like in 1960. We stopped  traveling then we we we went around the world for six months. We just closed the restaurant here  because we were the only restaurant we have in Moscow at that time. And when we come back when  we open our door or customers come back. In fact, some of them say oh, that's a good time for us to try  it because we didn't have such good food and you know 

30:00 
So we could have all our customers back within a very short time and they were glad to, to have us  come back. What are you asking? I'm wanting to Idaho being Chinese in Idaho? Three, or is different  than being Chinese in Bangkok? 

30:19 
About Vancouver? Notice 

30:23 
there isn't too much difference. You wouldn't know if you didn't live there. But I guess touring I tell you, I  think there's a difference in the way a tourist you know, the way you're treated. an oriental in Europe is  completely treated completely different from an American in Europe. Yeah, I think you're taking  advantage. I think it's to your advantage. I was never spoken rudely to course luck. I say I have a  completely different outlook on life anyway. But I was in Europe for five months and just traveling  around your real classes living in, you know, hostile, hostile doesn't. And I think that in lots of ways they  didn't know what I was. And because people don't know what you are, 

31:03 
you know, the bad feelings that they have against Americans like in your in France, like in France,  particularly is known to have bad feelings against the Americans? Well, I had no problems in France, I'd  like to get back to 

31:17 
you never answered 

31:20 
is about the culture and 

31:24
handed down from one generation to another? How did you react to that? And how do you feel about  your nieces and nephew? 

31:33 
Perhaps not getting the culture traditional background that 

31:38 
you had? 

31:40 
Well, I think that like Claire's, I think that she's put a lot of effort into trying to get her kids has exposed  as she can be. And really, I think that that probably as exposed as we were as kids. 

31:53 
So, you know, I didn't, you know, I don't see that they fucking others, you see, because there's, there's  gonna be different. All your other needs. Oh, now see, my other nieces and nephews are Yeah, they  aren't gonna, there are gonna be different. I think that it's if I had children, I will put the effort into  keeping the culture because I think that that's very much what makes us the way we are. I believe that  better part, I think that I think that growing up, I've never felt like I was any different from anybody else.  And I think that even though I've always yet I've known all the time, like I've looked at, you know, trying  to remember things. And as you know, whenever you'd feel out your things, like when you're in  children, they have you know, your nationality. You know, I always feel that Chinese I mean, it didn't  even dawn on me the fact that other kids were not feeling that out. And so, and just the fact that I was  and that I am that I was so sure of it, it just made me you know, so self sure assured and you know,  having the traditions and having the family to back me that I had no quit qualms or when people when  people would call out and make you know, comments, Susan was saying that, you know, people make  comments about you, you know, whether it's race well, I think you're well, you know, if they're not going  to pick on my race, they're gonna pick me because I, you know, you're fat or you have glass, your hair's  too long, you know, you, you know, you buck teeth, you know, they're gonna pick on you, for some  reason, if that's what they're gonna pick on you if they're gonna pick on you. And so, so when they  picked on me culturally, you know, like they would, you know, they I've had, you know, kids as a child,  I've had kids call me names, and seven year I didn't think any differently than if they would have called  a fat person fat. I mean, to me, that was just a part of them. And it's the kids that that was it didn't  bother, you know, sure it bothers you, but it didn't really, I just kind of brushed it off like, okay, they have  problems, they're also going to call that other kid fat, or they're going to also call that other kid, you  know, you know, a name for Whatever their reasons, and I didn't even dawn on me the fact that mine  was race oriented. You don't worry and theirs was not. I'm curious how that Susan and Debbie Michael  and Michelle feel about passing on or learning. Passing on your Chinese background the knowledge of  a two year 

34:14 
job? Oh, I definitely will. I definitely will. But to 

34:19 
extend on hers, I feel that when they when they call me names, having to do with my race, it takes me  more personal than if they tell me that I'm ugly. Because you are aware. I think it takes me It bothers  me more because they're insulting my whole race. They're insulting my whole background. And what I  believe in, and that's, that's worse to me than somebody calling me something that really is offended.  You're making a distinction, whereas Yeah, you hadn't married yeah, see, I do not feel that I'm so  secure In I knowing I'm Chinese and I know what my background is and feel so good about it, that I'm above 

35:00 
Have them as far as I'm concerned. It does not make any difference. I mean, they're just, you know,  what if they would insult your family though? See, that's that's 

35:08 
No, it's a cutting apart to lose. Well, if they cut apart Well, if they insult my family, that's one thing but  but they're not insulting. I mean, if they cut them down for it depends on what they're cutting them down  for what they're insulting. If they're assaulting only race, then I don't know, you know that I would take  that because then they can also say, well, your dad was a sneaky businessman, you see, that would  really bother me if they said Your dad's a sneak a sly businessman is saying, Debbie is just as  offended. I mean, I can remember, you know, her telling me about this case where she had this kid  right up, you know, he, he insulted her in the bus. And she just picked him up. And all of a sudden, she  was lumping him against the window of the bus, what was the and, and she and all the Oriental kids,  you know, that were the tennis team. And they were all trying to pull her off saying, Debbie, he was only  kidding, you know, whatever, whatever. And she said, You know, there's two things, she's something  against the wall in Hopkins, the window of the bus you do not touch on in one is more race. And the  other is my family walk up. 

36:18 
So that was now Thanks, Mom 

36:26 
has been 

36:28 
discriminated against because of the race. See, I didn't say this. So this is what I'm saying. When they  say discrimination, I've always felt like I've been special. Because I'm Oriental. Because I'm Chinese.  And I've always felt that all the way through school. If if, if in the classroom, they would recognize they  would know me first, before they knew all their other little faces in the room, they would know my name  first, they would know, you know, their expectations of me that they would know me for so I always  considered a special. I always thought that I'm so special that everybody's gonna notice me. So, to me,  it's never been a negative discrimination. It's always been positive. And, you know, and this is my  experience with it. And therefore, when kids call me names, it's just the fact that they're noticing that  there's something special about me about the rest of the family.

37:17
How about you, Susan? Have you ever had an experience where because you were Chinese, you were  treated differently in a rather negative way? 

37:31 
A little bit, but not a lot. 

37:35 
I mean, I don't think I could really remember me I was pretty I was 

37:40 
maybe in grade school or something that was a long time ago. 

37:45 
Not really, I just kind of brushed off. I think I hope being a 

37:55 
state that has so few 

38:01 
people in in in the towns are so small and smaller than some of the bigger schools that I think the  American children accept 

38:16 
foreign people more readily than they do in larger cities like Spokane, although I was never 

38:27 
fill our place overnight, of course, I was only in, I started with a first grade when no one I came to, to  Spokane, and 

38:37 
at that time, I don't think any of the other children do anything to hurt me in any way. But I don't often  talk about the items. 

38:52 
That's right. And that was one of the benefits of being raised in Moscow. Because, you know, of the,  you know, the fact that we are university city, that's our main, but it's smaller than the, you know, the  whole city are made up of students states that are made up of students and faculty. And you know, and  I think that that is where we've been really lucky, in, you know, being raised in Moscow, because, you  know, for example, when I first started teaching, in theory, I was probably, I feel glad that I was, you  know, an oriental teaching in a small community, because I feel that for the little Vietnamese kids that  came through the Koreans 

39:35 
and the Native Americans.

39:40 
So I'm not sure if we had any 

39:43 
Mexican Americans, but, you know, I feel that I was the one that kind of opened the door for the East,  made it easier for them to be accepted, you know, and I kind of felt well at the beginning, in my first few  years of teaching, it was it wasn't that you know, was outward 

40:00 
but I just kind of felt a little bit different, you know, amongst the faculty as well as you know, as maybe  the way that the parents were kind of looking at me. In other words, well, she's that way because she's,  you know, oriental type of thing. And I haven't even been called, you know, the dragon woman, you  know, the dragon lady or stuff like this, you know, but again, I, until I gained the respect, and a lot of  this, a lot of the people still feel is because I'm oriental that I expect so much of their kids and, and that  I, you know, demand, you know, and it's not because I'm the way I am lots of appeal, it's because, you  know, because I'm, that's my upbringing, you know, because I'm Oriental. Yet it's associated with  something positive. Right? It is. Now, at the time, it was a little bit difficult to, you know, my first classes  were a little bit difficult. But now, I think that they, you know, they see, they expect, I guess, Orientals to  be hard working, and the expectations to be great. And that we see beyond 

41:00 
just today, and my students know that, when I, that I'm interested in their complete, I mean, their total  future, you know, from the type of people they married to what they do with their lives to 

41:14 
what they do for careers. And so we were, you know, some people just want to teach the subject  matter, and that's where it ends. In fact, I've been told that in some ways I live, work, 

41:29 
you know, that I get too much into the personal lives of my kids, and I keep telling these people is  because, you know, I've had, you know, the next generation of kids I know. 

41:38 
And so therefore, it's natural for me to be able to tie things in, and expectations of them, etc. And, but  anyway, that's, I feel that I think it's a good time to ask if, if our view or to think of 

41:54 
the as a contribution or contributions that as the people as Chinese you you would have made to your  community or to Idaho in general, what would you how would you respond to that?

42:10 
Okay, I would say, probably, for most is
 
42:16 
our strong family ties. 

42:19 
And our being willing to work hard. 

42:24 
And, at least in our family, our, our strong belief and education. 

42:33 
How about you? 

42:37 
Well, I don't know, you can't really contribute too much to Idaho, you know, in this age, and 

42:45 
I just go along with my mom, we do have very strong ties, and I feel really special being Chinese and  stuff. Because you have a bonding with all the other Orientals, because you feel that, 

42:59 
that they share something that you have, because you they have the same background as you. 

43:05 
And even though you're not really related, you feel like your cousins, or you will, or brothers or sisters  or something, and you just tie in with that person really easy, and 

43:19 
have that relationship with him. 

43:23 
At the same time that you have this closely knit feeling of being Chinese or being Orientals, do you feel  that as a group with such a strong feeling about being together? 

43:36 
Do you feel though that you are easily able to integrate 

43:41 
into the community? 

43:45 
I think, in many ways, I think that's where we've been lucky to be of the race. That was really, at least  and the time, of course, 

43:56
to be pretty easily accepted. You know, it's, it says that, you know, all the races haven't had it as easily as we, 

44:08 
and 

44:10 
who didn't get on this surgery, but I feel that because of the black movement, and everything 

44:20 
that it has made it easier for us as Orientals to be accepted to be accepted. And, I mean, they're the  ones that have gone through the suffering. 

44:34 
And we have read the, we have been able to benefit from that. And it's, and I just 

44:41 
I said, I think that we're group you know, the Oriental group has been 

44:47 
really easily pretty easily assimilated, as far as, as far as our culture and our foods and our style of  living and, and even though you know, we can be really oriental, but 

45:00 
Still, when when our friends would come in, they could see, you know, us as being oriental, but they  could accept some of our differences and say that, you know, it's okay. You know, and I think I don't  know how to explain it where they haven't. Like I said, with the Native Americans, they haven't seen  much with the maybe the Middle Easterners, you know, they haven't with the blacks. They haven't with 

45:26 
some some of the Mexican Americans as easily as it has been. I don't know, maybe I'm just seeing it  out of the jet American Japanese. What pardon? For the American Japanese, they weren't, they didn't  have it very easy. And they had to go into concentration camps. I know. But that wasn't Yeah, I know.  But they had problems too. Or they had lots of problems. I mean, and again, I'm really just because of  the times that we're in, too. So what Marie, would you say, how was it? Well, I would say going into  college. Before we go into that, let me clarify something I had heard. The Where did you go to get your  college education I got from 

46:09 
Moscow High School, and the University of Idaho. And at that time, were you how many Chinese  students? Well, I was the only Chinese student. I was the only Chinese student as far as I, I'm sure I  was only a Chinese student in 1929. 

46:26
I started college at 1929. And then when you graduated, in 1933, I graduated two years after I was  married, because we wanted to get married at in 1931, when my husband came back 

46:44 
over here, and we decided, well, we were married when I was 21 years old, and on my birthday. And 

46:53 
I feel that Moscow and the University of Idaho and Washington state to help help our family to be what  we are. And Idaho is, is a very good state to be in. And I've 

47:10 
although I we lived in my parents and I lived in Washington for six years, but really, Moscow is my  home. I have been here since 1926. And I would never want to go anyplace else to live I do and  Moscow have the best weather as far as I'm concerned. We're a little bit cold in the in the wintertime,  but we need that to to, to kill the germs and all that you know, and I enjoy the for the for weather that  we have. And Moscow, especially 

47:46 
at one time, my father said, why don't you come over to Honolulu and buy a house there? I said I would  never live in Honolulu, about 31 days, about 30 days or three weeks is that just about all I can stand?  Anytime I'm over there. I said I want to get back to Idaho. And that's why we have the greens and we  have the grains and we have the the the tree you know and and we have our weather and I love it. 

48:21 
Idaho is considered a pretty written next state. I mean, there aren't very many 

48:26 
people other than white people in in Idaho and I was wondering if anybody here felt that you would be  better would have been better off in a more progressive state like California or New York or not? 

48:42 
Yes. Okay. Well don't print this one. Okay. 

48:47 
But 

48:49 
to be honest with you, between between wazoo and University of Idaho, maybe you want to see the  rednecks. There's a lot of over that. And, okay, as far as the business people, you know, in comparison  to us, I think we're business people. Yeah, I think Moscow 

49:06 
thing. You don't you don't you don't say that about Washington?

49:13 
Idaho, to shut that thing off? That No, no, not not. I 

49:19 
mean, see, it's Pullman. Yeah, it's busy. I just 

49:23 
I just, you know, after in very, very closely related to Alan's that question is, it would seem that you all  perceive you're 

49:34 
kind of an ease in terms of fitting in to the community. 

49:38 
I would be I would be curious to know what that has essentially open for you say memberships in  organization for turnout stations. Has it been open to you as easily as 

49:52 
well? It was not open to us at all. In my time. We were 

50:00 
Although we were 

50:02 
not able to get into hardly any association, except for the church, and the farmers, 

50:12 
a part of the community, we liked the four h. And, and 

50:19 
those things we can go into anything related with education. We were very welcomed into their their  doings, but some of the fraternal and other sunless metals 

50:35 
they will not. They will not welcome us. How about 

50:41 
in your generation clear and Marian? 

50:47 
Well, we've never been really formally invited, I had a friend who was a gas station owner. And he was  all dressed up pretty dirty, and came to me and says, Learn rejoining moose. 

50:59
And I kind of smiled and said, No, thank you. I didn't, I didn't feel a moose was was something that I  wanted to be. And that was the most was anything. 

51:11 
Raising, raising my standard, so I was just too busy, busy anyhow. So I wouldn't 

51:18 
know as far as the Elks was concerned. I never seek to become a member of the Rotary, no, the lions. 

51:26 
Never nobody asked me and I never really looked looked forward to it. Using an oral of this  organization, you need to be invited to become a member? Well, I am the lions in the Rotary. 

51:42 
I think you have to be invited. 

51:45 
And we're running that thing. I make one count comment. 

51:49 
How does that make it feel? To have been able to see him? You Your family has dated a long history,  and it has a long history in Moscow, in particular, and you've continued on 

52:05 
actually being very prominent part of the business community, we do contribute to different political  party or friends who are doing this type of stuff. But as far as taking 

52:22 
as member of members of some of this organization, it seems like it hasn't happened. And and how do  you feel about that? 

52:35 
Because it doesn't bother me. It does. I'm so busy with everything I do. Why these are so short that I  can't dwell on anything. 

52:48 
I could say something. 

52:53 
Because I don't like it. I don't want it down there. While you don't 

52:57 
read it is the thing I do not want and he wouldn't want. That's what he said.

53:07 
Well, alright, this is a very opinionated statement. I just didn't have it not printed. Okay. 

53:14 
All right. Yeah. I wouldn't, yeah. Okay. I will. 

53:19 
Go, would you would you desire to 

53:23 
be more active, say in city government or in the conduct of city and county affairs, if you 

53:33 
if you had an opportunity? Or would you even seek that opportunity on behalf of yourself and maybe  the Asian community? 

53:43 
Even though I read the newspapers and keep up with what's going on? 

53:47 
I have, I've never been able to reach a good, solid decision. I've always been able to see both. Both  sides of the voters have their opinions. And 

54:00 
I'm always curious to know who wins and who loses and like to know what they would be for see  yourself stepping in and 

54:10 
taking part No, no, no way. I see that. 

54:17 
Moscow has something unusual to Asian Club of mixed Chinese Japanese, 

54:23 
in other communities. Chinese. 

54:27 
What do you think about them? I think it's been great. 

54:31 
To, especially for 

54:36
I mean, it came in I mean, it isn't all that old. I'm an organization and I wish it had been there. You  know, when we maybe were first married. But for us and for our kids. I have really been glad that it was  formed because it has given the kids a chance to make contacts probably 

55:00 
I just feel a little bit sorry that they haven't been able to 

55:05 
take some of these friendships on farther that you know, in some of these associations. 

55:12 
But I think it's been really good for the, for this community. And since and it has really opened up all of our eyes, as far as, you know, the intercultural amongst the Oriental races, I see a smile and Debbie's  face when you 

55:35 
want to take one take on 

55:40 
extensions that are well, sample, I mean, you see, LaBrecque has kids all this time, and it's several  several of meetings. And yet, and yet, you know, her son has never bothered asking you to go  anyplace or whatever. And, you know, I just, 

55:58 
you know, or Well, the thing is, the thing is, I think, I think the thing is, is that 

56:06 
there's an age difference, there's an age difference. And there there is, he lives in a different place, and  you're embarrassing me. Oh, no, I mean, that's just all these associations with a dairy kids, but he  doesn't, you know, it's just you don't sit there and, and pick out people to sit there and do no, you don't  you don't do that. I don't believe in it. I don't, I don't believe in saying okay, well, you know, he's  Chinese. So maybe we should go out and, you know, maybe it'll lead into something, you know, I don't I  don't believe in that. If it's going to if it's going to work, it'll work. You know, if it doesn't well, then it  doesn't you just don't You don't 

56:44 
force it. Yeah, you don't force those types of things. You don't sit there and say yes, you are gonna  marry a Chinese because you can't, you can't see the future. And you know, even though you believe  in that it happens. 

56:57 
Whether it's in our family, or it's in somebody else's family, leaving it the way it is 111 step toward it  already. Let's hear something from Michelle.

57:08 
We haven't heard anything from Michelle, why don't you describe yourself? You're, 

57:14 
you're 10 years old. 

57:20 
She's 11 years old. Gosh, I lost one of the years I've been doing so many other things that I can keep  track of all my love and grandchildren. 

57:32 
Plus, no more. But, you know, what more did I expect of the association? Okay. And it's like I said, I  would have hoped that it would just open you know, again, like when I have my kids go to all these  different organizations, from for H to piano to whatever you know, I hope that it's going to open up new  opportunities for different types of friendships. And I was hoping for the same 

57:54 
was after one second. 

58:01 
We
