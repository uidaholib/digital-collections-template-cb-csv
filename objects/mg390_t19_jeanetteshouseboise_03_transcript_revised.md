00:07 
I wish that they were, but they were not. And so one of the things which led me to the Philippines and in  and to be my interest in Asia, I'm sure was that richness of of adding that on to myself, I mean, I cannot  look Asian. But there's no reason that I can't share Asian culture, appreciate Asian family values and  things like that. And I use that in a generic sense, not necessarily a particular one. But as you had  mentioned, Ludi, the family thing, the value of the family was something that was very much enriched in  my mind. 

00:59 
Growing up with, with my parents, it was a fairly typical American family where there wasn't a lot of real  closeness. And when you got to be 18, you left home and you wrote every so often and went back on  major holidays, but there was not a real closeness. And going to the Philippines, it was, it was really an  experience, being able to share that real tight cohesiveness that extends clear into people that you  barely even know. And that was very, very powerful to me, I don't want my children to lose it. 

01:32 
And do you know, having having seen the, seeing the, or appreciate the closeness of Filipino family?  Do you feel an obligation or sense that you would like to have that fostered in your own family? 

01:51 
Exactly. I do feel that way. I know that from some of my friends in the Philippines, that family can be  very stifling, too. And I had friends in graduate school and beyond living at home with their parents and  really wishing that they could break out and establish more of an independent identity. So it has its  pluses and minuses. But I think growing up in this culture, you get enough of the pluses of  independence that you need some of the pluses of the other side to counterbalance  
Rounded out? Or how how would you address this issue? Closeness and independence? How do you  feel about that? 

02:40 
Oh, I think I agree with that that essentially, you enrich the children by exporting to them to both ideas.  And you, as parents could always point out that there's that said, there is that by the fact of this very  strong family being very, you know, it could be very demanding. But there's a lot to be said about this  closeness to. And I think what I have discussed this with my son's it's not it's not really to inculcate in  their mind that this is it, it is just saying, hey, there is you know, there's another way there's another  system. It was not perfect, like this system, but you know, you can make both use of this system. And I
think they have appreciated that they they know that I I don't have to use that bad side of it. I could get  that one and give that away. Take this one away. So it's a good parting, I think. 

03:56 
Sounds like youâ€™re giving the best of best of both worlds. 

03:59 
Yeah, but never to the point that say, this is the Filipino way I want to do it this way. No. Yes.  Presenting the presenting with the alternatives. 

04:12 
One thing that I've found difficult here in Idaho is finding materials, reading materials and things that  you can really share them a good view of, at least what I remember the Philippines was like. The story  books, books for children and things like that which have images of of Asians and whites and blacks  and things interacting. You don't find those materials very much, certainly not as much as you would in  metropolitan areas like Seattle. 

04:49 
Oh, once you once you introduce them, like my second son David. Like last Christmas, he brought me  a lot of books. Uh, from University of Chicago about the Philippines, he himself has been reading it.  You know, I've talked to him, anthropology finds in Bagyu and all those things. And he took it upon  himself and he brought me six volumes of very, very early Spanish. That was the first time I knew that  (unintelligible) by Chinese, you know, that was their results by Chinese from this book. So he is very  interested just mainly because of what they've heard from me. The whole thing, then, sensibly that I  wish I knew more about this, anthropological studies in the Philippines, as I like, I know, my I know,  read a little bit about Southwest and quality and those things. So you lay the groundwork, I guess that's  essentially why they would be I mean, then 

06:00 
We've reread all of my old Carlos (unintelligible) books and things like that. My son loves to read,  though, but that reading how other people have dealt with that experience of being a minority in a  majority culture, and that and that's what I enjoyed about being in the Philippines is being put in that  situation where you're the odd person out now. 

06:29 
The minority and majority issue is that something that you are concerned about as far as your children  and in the course of their growing up? 

06:37 
I don't know whether you've noticed with the responses of the kids made, they're not they don't  perceive themselves, any different from the other kids. And I think that's a very healthy, healthy attitude,  you know, and I think, I think they can weather anything, you know, that will come their way having that  kind of an attitude that, you know, I'm not, I'm a person like you, basically. Now, I'm not saying they're  color blind, but you know, they know their heritage, but they're also asserting that I'm a person first, 
before I'm a Filipino American. You know, and I think that's, you know, and I'm glad I'm hearing that  from all these kids. (unintelligible) for the fact that he was on display that sophistication of  understanding, perhaps, maybe, 

07:22 
we also realized that the society that we live in, seems to have just a very thin veneer, sometimes of  that openness and tolerance. And that even as much as you try to do in the home, to expose them and  yet protect them, they're still going to get into situations sometimes where they're going to have to deal  with things.  
How do you prepare them for that? 
How do you how do you prepare anyone for that? 
Yeah, because sometimes they have to go through the healthy 

07:57 
self esteem. The fact that they accept themselves for what they are, I think that would be their best  weapon later on, to deal with issues like this. 

08:15 
different skin colors. 

08:23 
I was saying something about that. 

08:24 
Yes. Something maybe about the fact that your children, Steven was?  

08:32 
No, it's three of them. Three of them, I think could pass for Caucasian. If they want to. If you take off  last names, yeah. Without if they didn't have the name of Vega, the third, the fourth one? Could not.  And he, I suppose, has experienced I don't know if it's because he's experienced the most  discrimination or if he's just most interested in it, and most sensitive to it. But anyway, he does. He  reports more. He and he feels it more 

08:59 
reports more incidents? So yeah, 

09:01 
he mentions it more now. And I don't know if it's just because it's obvious from his face that he's not  Caucasian-American. Oh, and he's the one that insisted the most that he wasn't an American and didn't  feel like an American. And first, he wanted to go back to the Pacific to live. And now he wants to stay  here and cure the ills of American society. But anyway, he's he's very interested in discrimination. And 
in fact, he's working on a research project right now in Chicago is something about Lincoln, you know,  the 

09:33 
slavery. I think it's mainly basically the type of David that's a guy, his personality. He's very, very  conscious about social effects. Compared to the first one, Stephen. That's about the farthest in his  mind. I mean, he's all science. How David is in the social science and that really intrigues him. As  Cheryl was saying, the summer the last two summers his job has been to work with this professor that  dealt with the Abe Lincoln and the slavery. That to him is just  
Different attitudes  
Very, very, very intriguing topic any he would spend hours and hours researching those things. 

10:26 
But he also gets upset at the way people are treated like he had a roommate in college is the father is  white and the mother is black. And you know, things happen they just do discrimination. And this is in  Chicago too. So but but like I said over here, it's it's in Boise to discrimination it has. It has a veneer  over it, but it's there, even you go to a kid's soccer game, and you'll hear the kids say, hey, get that  Chinese kid. 

10:55 
I just heard Steven, no Bryan say something in here as far as the discrimination. Do you see?  Manifestations of this discriminate discrimination? 

11:10 
Manifestations of evidence? 

11:13 
I don't know. It's just that like your last name. I mean, there's some kids in our school that are ours  dives. I mean, there's kids in our school that are as dark as me, I don't know if it's because they sit out  in the sun or what but their last name is Jones or Richardson or something like that. And they don't get  called a Mexican, or, you know, something like that. It's just because you're labeled Vega, or that's your  last name. So it's your Mexican. I mean, you know, because most Vegas, they know are Mexicans, and  so they get that thing like you're Mexican, even though you're not. 

11:52 
That is quite, quite apart. Because of that. I guess the name Vega is, I guess, in any Spanish  community. And this again, as I said, and Ted says, Southwest Southwestern Idaho is just a lot of  Hispanic people 

12:12 
people in Boise don't know one from another. If you're not white, they'll they just assumed to call your  (*****) as a Mexican, I mean, or Chinese or whatever. I mean, they were just just a label. They don't they don't know I think I think most of them don't even know that nigger means black, they'll just call me  nigger because they know that an epithet or a put down and they see that you're not white. And so and 

12:34 
that works both way. Like as I said, I'm part of agriculture and I, you know, go to these farms and with  the migrant labor, once the hurdle is vague. They will talk behind you is that that's a guy he's Mexican  isn't he? Itâ€™s in Spanish, but you could understand it that saying, Well, what is this Mexican doing in the  Department of Agriculture is not 

13:07 
going to experience some kind of a discrimination because their? 

13:14 
My, my eldest son was the one who was more vocal of the two kids I have. And I think that there were  instances when he would come home with some stories, but it is more of like, just like his experience  being Mexican, and he was always quick to tell them I am not Mexican, I'm a Filipino because the  (unintelligible) so it's also Mexican name. So I think they made it clear from the beginning. It's good.  They made the effort to establish themselves as Filipinos and not Mexican. And I don't think there was  ever any

13:49 
Jeanette, I have noticed you are very, you seem very happy when you are very active in Civic Type  pursuits.  
Not really.  
I'd like to ask as Filipinos Filipino American families, how do you see yourself in the the I mean, Boise  in terms of community and effect integration, and the rest of Boiseans? 

14:18 
When I was growing up, I was a recipient of people's kindness many times, and I just felt good that now  I am in a position where I can do some good things for people. And when I do some, well I like to say  when I do thing isn't necessarily because I wanted it. I guess my my attitude is if I have somebody, this  person might not necessarily help me but he will help another person. And that's how I feel about it. 

14:53 
Absolutely, we're saying earlier is planting a seedâ€¦ 

14:58 
Because I feel good I When I was growing up, there were a lot of people who went out of their way to  do to do a lot of things for me. And without those kinds of things that other people did for me, I don't  think I would be what I am now. 

15:15
So you're passing it on carrying it on by doing, 

15:19 
And I am a strong supporter of education, I just strongly believe in education. 

15:26 
That education is often identified as one of the higher one of the values that's associated with with  Asians. Is that something thatâ€¦ How do you feel about education andâ€¦? 

15:43 
You know, like, loosely, most Asians, I think I value education very highly. And I think you could trace  that back in our culture, you know, in the Philippines, when you as you go back in history. The only way  somebody gets out of your of your present economic situation is to get more education. And because  the more education you get, the more you can improve your lives. And I think that's, you know, we still  have that sense of attitude towards education is that you know, you to better yourself, you need to get  more education. And we pass that on to our kids to consciously inculcate. Oh, yes. And, you know, we  make an effort to do that at home. I mean, it's, we tell them studying is their first job right now. That's  their main job. Later on, they'll have their own job, which is probably not studying. But right now, their  main job is education. 

16:40 
When our kids were growing up, they have chores. But the deal has always been if you have  homework, nevermind, we'll do your chores, right? 

16:56 
What do you children think about that fact that your parents value education so much and remind you  every day so every 

17:04 
night they have homework? So that they don't have to watch this? 

17:10 
I tried to ask this DuBois. 

17:18 
So do you share your parents Valley value of education? 

17:24 
Well, I don't know about that. But I I always try to get my homework done fast. So I can do something  else. Very good. 

17:37 
Yes, no problem.

17:39 
Yet anyway. 

17:45 
Hey, what's an honor rolls in junior high. They're both doing pretty well. Fortunately, our gauge has  been. 

17:58 
We don't ever have to tell him that. We don't have any deals. But 

18:04 
somewhere along the line, somebody would have set an example for them. I don't know. I 

18:10 
know, you've all talked about doing all these kinds of things consciously. I don't know. I guess we're just  lucky, Ralph. He's been planning real well, that's it. It just all seems so natural. And you know, 

18:23 
I have not consciously laid the ground that that seven to eight you got to be studying. 

18:33 
How you go to school? 

18:38 
Asked them when things done. Yeah, talk about it. But at least I didn't think that with a stick and said,  Hey, you get going. 

19:02 
One thing that one difference that I've noticed about a number of the minority communities here in  Boise as opposed to poor minorities here in Boise, as opposed to in Seattle, where I was going to  school before. Here I find many of the minorities wanting to just blend in not drawing attention to their  Filipino nests or their whatever it is. I remember here in Boise it part of my responsibilities at work we  work with the federal government when they come in to audit our affirmative action programs. And the  last time they came in, they wanted to speak with several of our engineers, whatever who happened to  be minorities and I can remember very distinctly one of the Hispanic engineers saying after I'd call him  up to tell him we wanted to get together with him you were five you singled me out. Why me? What?  What is it? He didn't want? You know, it was because you were Hispanic. Well, what does that have to  do with it? I'm here as an engineer. I've never drawn a tan and never asked for anything. And, and I  don't know necessarily I'd be curious to see how how others feel about that. But I've noticed that
