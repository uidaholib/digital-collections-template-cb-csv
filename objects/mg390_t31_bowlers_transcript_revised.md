I am a strong supporter of education, I just strongly believe in education. I think a student here who  wants to go to college is highly motivated, would have a better chance of going to college and finishing  college than the one who's in the Philippines, who wants to go to college and doesn't have the  resources to go to college, even though he's highly motivated, I mean, the chances are, he won't go  and finish college. 

00:55 
I have benefited from not only the tradition of knowing my grandma, my grandparents on both sides,  and I guess cherishing those memories, but also being fostered in an environment where education  was a very key role. And I think that that's an outstanding element in most Japanese families. But it's  
not a direct education, so to speak. It's an application to life. My parents would share going to where,  we would travel, and it wouldn't matter whether it was from here to Blackfoot or, or to a foreign country,  and they would save up and they would give my sister and I the benefits of traveling. And they taught  us that probably 99% of our education would come through travel and learning to deal with people in  our circumstances. But they were, I guess, smart enough to qualify that statement and say that without  a formal education, we'd never truly be able to appreciate those experiences. 

02:00 
My husband and I had always enjoyed, and he really believes in education. And through his effort and  persistence. Many of our Chinese friend, older friends in our generation, not quite as modern as we are  not graduates of college, but they are good people and we tried to push through it them to send their  children to, on to school. Even, even our good friend in Walla Walla who has a large farm. He said to  our I don't see why my boy have to go to agriculture school because he I can teach him all all I know.  But then my husband said no, because he he can learn all you know, but he can also learn more from  the modern agriculture, and can produce more and they can save more and do things more. And then  also, we have been persuading our friends in Spokane, Walla Walla, even in Pullman, you know, to  send the daughters to school too. The Chinese attitude is that well, our daughter's got to be married  and to her husband's family, why should we spend the money to educate our daughters when they go  live live, with, with the other family anyway. But we always tell them that it doesn't hurt for a girl to to  have a good education and be able to support herself in case of necessity. That then she does not  have to obey and and do what their husbands want them to do. 
The idea my, my husband feels is that going to school is going to school and you have no time to be  dating. And so he said Well, wait till they're at least a junior at college before me Dave as a junior No,  but he didn't like to have you do but he did not forbid you to do it. 

04:26 
But yeah, I was married by the time I was a sophomore. In other words, he let he'd let us go out as long as… 

04:43 
and do what their husbands want them to do. Their idea my, my husband feels is that going to school is  going to school and you have no time to be dating. And so He said, Well, wait till they're at least a junior  at college before.  
Not me, I was a junior  
No, but he didn't like to have you do but he did not forbid you to do it. 

05:14 
I was married by the time I was a sophomore. In other words, he let he let us go out as long as it's the  right person, right and the right person had to be 

05:25 
Chinese. Not not that not that we have anything against the American people. It is much better. If you  do marry within your own race, you have a background together, the same background, the same. The  same cultures and the same ideas that the Chinese people have. 

05:55 
We have heard that Filipinos have a very high intermarriage rate. Can you comment on that? 

06:04 
That's what I can see. That's what I can see. Because my son is married to an American. And my, my  other son is married to a Japanese and my other son is married to American. I mean, my daughter is  married to American, and I don’t have any pictures. Yeah, she married to American. So that's what it is. They're all. I don't have any full Filipino children.  

06:38 
Why? Why do you think that is so? Yeah, good question.  

06:44 
Well, the reason… Well, I really can't say anything about that. But I think the reason is that we don't  have many of our people in here. You see, when he was still a minister in California, early part of his  ministry, they did not allow marriages, intermarriage like that. So so he cannot marry. So we have been  bringing these people who wants to marry another nationality to Reno. In fact, we have brought about  seven of them. 

07:23 
So when you say they can you clarify that who would not allow? 

07:27 
The law below in California, California, California, maybe maybe in United States? I didn't know how I  didn't know this. But in California, they didn't. It was not allowed for, for intermarry intermarriages. So he  can marry them. 

07:46 
So Reverend Caollo knew would take them to Reno? 
Yes. 

07:56 
Well, how did you feel about the intermarriage? What do you think of intermarriage? i 

08:05 
Well, so far, like I have been talking to him that in my observation here, although there are many that  we know who are as good as when they are Filipinos, or there are Americans, it's themselves see that  there are many that I know that we deal with, that they have the best husbands, they have the has, the  they're the best husbands in the American side. 

08:40 
The races have been able to mix and be a cohesive group. You know, I always thought that when when  I was younger, I had a friend who was Caucasian and I it was a very dear friend because we live he just  lived down the street and ways and and if something came up and he proposed to me, I still as much  as I thought of him I wouldn't have thought of marrying him because at the time Caucasians were you  know, and Japanese marriages just just didn't go and they had all these laws to that that regulated us  from. So since that time, it's really been almost a complete turnover and because we have children in,  on his side of the family, and mine too, who are married to Caucasians and being very nice land I think I  think just as much as the daughter in-laws. If you know if they were Japanese and I think the  grandchildren naturally they're just your grandkids and just extra special and like you say we've got  blonde and darn near blonde, blue eyes and curly hair. You know, I said I'm, I've often wondered  Mother would think if she saw clearly a granddaughter or grandchild because in all in Japanese always  had a straight black hair. And here we have our grandchildren who are pretty curly brown hair and  beautiful olive complexion and everything. And somehow I feel like that the offsprings have an inner  marriage, the children seem to be stronger and healthier, better, and stature, they're taller. They're  better looking. They're much more intelligent in school. I mean, all the children, you know, I've done  very well in school. So far, so they always talk about hybrid, you know, the first strain of a hybrid being  so good, whether it's wheat or corn or whatever. I kind of think that with children, too. 

11:01
We, each of us, when we graduated from high school, went to Hawaii for a summer. Yeah, of course,  we had been raised, you know, amongst, you know, in Moscow, essentially, in an all Caucasian  community. 
Atmosphere.  
And so when I went to Hawaii was the first time I had been immersed into, you know, a multicultural  setting. And I realized when I came back, that my dad was right, and that I would marry within my, you  know, with it, at least within the Orientals. And so then Leonard and I started, Leonard already had was  working on his master's. And so we started dating when I was a freshman in college, I was married at  the beginning of my sophomore year. And I really feel and you can ask my own children, this because  they've also gone through this. But I still feel quite strongly, 

11:51 
You would say you're racing your family, you and Leonard, in according to the traditional, traditional Chinese way? 

11:59 
Well, from the standpoint of who they marry, okay, and who they want to make lifetime commitments to  as far as a family. 

12:08 
How do you feel about that? 

12:10 
I don't know. I never, thought about it. 

12:13 
I just kind of think about more of getting through college and finding my own career before I even think  of having somebody else to marry.  
They have a lot of priorities as to what what kind of guys that we date, they would want us to marry a  Chinese and in our race. I think it's, I think it's kind of sad how, how they only want us to marry in our  race. I agree, in I see their standpoint, but it's, it's it's a modern world, and you have to, you're living in a  white world. So I think of myself as both Chinese and American and white and stuff. 

13:03 
The strongest feeling I got from my parents was, it's about time. I was 27 or something at that point.  But they, they felt that I was ready for that. And, of course, it's difficult to think of yourself married when  you're single. But in retrospect, I think I was to, Luti’s parents were, I'm sure a bit apprehensive, more  for her sake, I think than mine. They were concerned that she wouldn't finish school, that she had been  a valedictorian and all of these things in school and they had great aspirations for her. She had great  aspirations and they thought when she married somebody, somebody from Caldwell, Idaho, where she  gonna go? I think it's worked out alright.

14:07 
I think it's also, you know, parents never tell you really what, you know, how they feel. I mean, it's part  of the culture they infer, right? I mean, it's all infer, and I think my mom has inferred to me that when  she grows old, you know, I won't be there as a girl, you know, usually the woman takes care of your  aging parents and, and she was quite, she was quite apprehensive about that. But I won't be around, of  course, because of course I will follow my husband. 

14:34 
And so, so how is it now? 

14:38 
She comes every two years, sometimes with my mom or with just a mum, I mean with my dad, and she  comes tovisit and I tell her, you know, when she needs me, I'll be ready. Being around my kids do. 

14:55 
My mother would have been worried if I married somebody else. Just You know, be sure you know  what you're doing. Be sure it works.  
They were of divorce. Because they had the idea that everybody in America gets divorced. The time we were going to get married. Another one from Los monos, my hometown. I was in the  process of getting divorced with his American wife, who happens to be a good family friend. So that  was something that my mother asked, Well, are you aware of this? Are you aware of that? I of course  said yes. But like any ideal is it ever happened to me? 

15:39 
Well, we were noticing as we were interviewing people… 

15:52 
What do you want to do once you graduate here? Yeah, because 

15:54 
I just go to school and be cosmetologist. 

15:58 
Do you want to do that here in Kellogg or? Yeah. What do you think about the gondola project?

16:05 
I think it's neat. It's gonna bring a lot of business here. A lot of different people, maybe tourists. 

16:11 
Do you think your friends might hang around here after graduating from high school as well? Or what  do you think?

16:18 
Yeah, I think they will. 

16:21 
Thanks. Hey. Hi, how are you? 

16:26 
I'm Simon Miller. Simon, what your junior? 

16:30 
And do you have any plans after graduation? 

16:33 
Think I'm just gonna go to college and come back. See what I can find through job 

16:38 
plan. I'm coming back to Kellogg. Yeah, I'd like to. Where do you want to go to school? And what do  you want to study? 

16:45 
Probably the University of Idaho. I don't have declared a major yet. I don't I just kind of go with the flow  and see what happens. 

16:53 
Tell me about the gondola. Ride. I 

16:56 
think it's the best thing since sliced bread. Really? It's gonna make this place. Boom, I think. I think it's  really good for the economy and everything. What are your friends? Think about it. I think it's great. We  won't have to drive up that long hill that go skiing, we can just ride up a little gondola instead of driving  that long way. It's kind of a pain. 

17:14 
Are you scared? Yeah. 

17:15 
I'm scared. It's great up there. 

17:18 
What do you think it will do to the area? It's gonna 

17:20 
be great. It's gonna expand and everything I guess and it's just gonna boom, it's gonna be great.  Thanks.

17:29 
Government. 

17:34 
Tell me who you are. 

17:35 
Any big spring? What are you a senior Kellogg High School? 

17:40 
And what do you plan to do after graduation? 

17:42 
I'm going into the service, the army. 

17:46 
And do you have any plans on coming back to Kellogg? 

17:49 
Yeah, hopefully. What do you I don't want to come back and live here. I just want to come back and see  how I just want to come back and visit my family and stuff. 

18:00 
What do you think of the gondola project?

18:01 
I think it's really neat. I think it'll hopefully it'll add something to this town. Do something for it and make  it more prosperous, I guess. 

18:12 
What do you most of your friends here think about it? 

18:16 
Well, high school I don't really think anything really is my friends. It's I think it's just more the older  people that really want this. But it'd be neat. If you're a skier I guess we need to go out there. 

18:29 
Do you think any of the young people will benefit from a project like this? 

18:34 
Younger people that might want jobs in high school? Maybe 

18:39
these skate All I see 

18:41 
is look out for summer. 

18:43 
Would you ski up here once things are done? I probably would. Would you tell your friends to ski up  here?

18:50 
Would I? If they got the gondola? Yeah, it'd be neat to write up on one of those things. Thanks
