00:45 I was just really wondering what is going to be understood now?

00:56 Okay. Would it be better if I said over on the other side maybe or no? I either. Yeah, that would be  okay. Don't have to keep looking at me this way.

01:19 I know. I know. How should I address Mr. Callao? Oh, Mr. Callao. Oh, no. (unintelligible) 

01:37 I would address the question to both of you. When did you first come to the United States? Well, Mr.  Callao out 
I remember my new my dad was at the start on school. My dad was that again? 1928. Because you 

02:11 and then then where are you in about that time? 

02:19 What town? 

02:21 Can San Francisco 

02:23 No, when we came here? 

02:28 When you first came to America, you were in what place? 

02:33 Well, 

02:36 independent San Francisco. We were in San Francisco when we first came up to San Francisco. 

02:45 Maybe would you rather that you maybe I talk to you more today? (unintelligible) Okay.  
Um, intention I managed to find out on History News, Idaho. So then when Mrs. Callao, how did, how  did both of you come to live in Idaho? 

03:12 My son was in the Air Force here in Mountain Home, Idaho. And well, when he was discharged, he  thought maybe he would like to stay here. And as a matter of fact, he got married here. And then that  time my husband also had a car accident in California and California was really getting so crowded that  I feel it was good for us to be in a smaller place. When really, when we first game here. Boise was  small, really  
Smaller than it is now?
older than fair. As matter of fact for the mobile home that we have. We it was in a one acre and a half,  almost pasture, pasture land. And now for 21 years. You'll see subdivision and in the street fair we has  so many subdivisions, big condominiums and all the pasture land here is a big big business case for  like Albertson and all the big, big firms. IBM and all that. 

04:48 Coming from there. Did I hear you say you came from California. Coming from California. How did you  find Idaho? How did you find Boise Idaho? 

04:58 Like I said, My son was here. He was in the Air Force. And we come and visit him every summer. And  when my husband retired, he and his wife thought, maybe come and retire here. So that's how we  came in here.

05:18 What changes have you seen in Boise since you came? 

05:24 In what way? 

05:26 changes in the way people live changes in the way children are being raised or? 

05:36 Like, when we first came here, really, I was lost. Because when we came here, we saw only… Well, my  son was the only Filipino here. But then, a month later, we saw another Filipino married to American.  Then, from there, I tried to inquire where Filipinos are, Filipinos are, if there are any Filipinos around.  And so we, this is kind of funny when we saw this. So it was a funeral that that started us to see a  Filipino in Caldwell. And that's how it is. And then we saw also a dis, those who are good, those who  are heading their naturalization a Filipina girl, and we traced we didn't know her address, but we trace it  through the post office. And through her she introduce a couple. We visited this couple. And you can  believe it this couple. The first time we met. They, they were very, very like, they were our children, or  they were We were their parents. And from then on that was in 1968. Till now they call us mom and pa. 
That's very nice. 
And we were really good. We can adapt them to be our children 

07:26 Are they Fillipino also? 

07:29 The lady is a Filipino. She is (unintelligible). And the husband is, of course America. He was but he was  a servicemen who stayed up in for a long time in Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. And he is  more of adapting our ways. Yeah. 

07:58 I understand your husband was the minister at one time? 

08:04 He in 1933 or 32. He was just volunteering us to work, to work for, among the Filipinos volunteering,  because we didn't have a church or we didn't. You know, we that time that they, they never even tried  to give a chance for the Filipinos to have a place to worship. We had been worse being from place to  place. And even, that he tried his very best until he was given a church. Heaven have met this and  Presbyterian, but the Methodist did not did not fulfill the promise of heaven. So the Presbyterian gave  scholarship to my husband to go to the San Francisco Theological Seminary for the Presbyterian.  When he graduated them, then we have a church. He organized the church. They didn't really leave the  church, we organized the church and the American churches had been a cooperating with us until we  were connected with board of national mission. 

09:37 And how long did he preach? 

09:39 He was… Since he excluding his volunteers. He preached for almost almost 39 years. 

09:52 How old is Reverend Callao? How old are you sir? 

09:59 90. 

10:01 1990, yeah, right, 

10:02 And you, Mrs. Callao?  

10:05 82 almost 83. 

10:10 So you came to Boise, when your son invited you to come and stay? How did you how did the church  help you with your integration or social interactions in the community? 

10:25 In here? 
Yes.  
What do you say, when, we came here, we selected the church that we were going to, then we  selected a smaller church, which was called the second Presbyterian Church, it was just a small  church. And at that time, since my husband was still strong, strong and able to help, he was asked to  help in ways, some ways in the church that said, but then, when he was not able anymore, we just go  for our regular church attendance, like me, too, we are used to help but now I cannot do anything  anymore, because I have to put all my care for him. But in spite, because we were not able to do more  of our church to to the church. Since we have few Filipino couples here, families here then few, maybe  there were about three or four. And we started like, say, suppose instead of just visiting one another,  we will just have to, we will make it this way. He said, We will visit you Sunday, and then we extend and  the other Sunday, and then the other Sunday. And you know, how Filipinos are when you visit, you  have some something to eat. And it became to be that this young couples, Filipino couples, they feel  that we being as elderly, they have that respect. And they said, well, it is really nice that they said yes.  Really nice. So what is that? Well, I will give you another proposition is that instead of just visiting and  eating, he said, We suppose we will have a prayer meeting first, or study the Bible and then after that,  then we visit it. And we did that for years, until he was not able to see his eyes had been now damaged  with a car accident in 66 and we can use it then. So he said well, I think I can’t help anymore. So that's  what it is. 

13:07 Can, can you share with us some of your memorable experiences? Perhaps both in California and here  in Idaho? 

13:18 What would you say are your memorable experiences that could be either something positive or  negative? Or what are some of the things that you remember the most? 

13:33 Any questions you want to Yeah Can we just disconnect this Yeah, no? Let me do it for you… 

13:56 I can I can ask another question which is, what other what other Asian groups out there in Boise and do  you do things with them together socially? 

14:10 No. Yes our 

14:12 could you get closer? 

14:17 yes our groups 

14:21 you You mean you keep to Filipinos you interact with Filipinos mostly? Why is that you think? 

14:30 When we came here there is no Filipino the Oba yes sir but one family. Only one family only when we  came here, right? Yeah, yes. Yeah, yeah. And then (unintelligible) just like this? 

15:04 There are many. There are really many of them. But, of course, everybody seems to be working. And  we have, when, sometime how many years ago that we have when we were having about, say maybe  about more five or six families, we started to have, we he inspired them to that we should be having a  community, community, Filipino community. And so it was organized, we have organized and we have  all these Park picnics and parties. And mostly we have this every Christmas or having a Christmas  party for the kids especially and it was improving, it was really improving. But then, when he was not  strong enough, they were running it themselves. So I don't know how it's going now. 

16:14 Do you do do any activities with say the members of the Chinese community or the Japanese  community in the area? No. 

16:25 No,It's not the fact that we didn't even have any Japanese group that we know. Yes. And even nothing  but Chinese. 

16:44 Filipino when we came here, there is only one Filipino No.

17:12 Just one family. Right now how many families 

17:22 there are many. There are many now. 

17:27 What? It sounded to me like at the beginning, you were you're there were just not many Filipinos and  you were about the only ones. What made you stay that long in Idaho? What made you? 

17:41 Well, my son was here.
