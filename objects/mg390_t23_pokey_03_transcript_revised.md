00:09 
Not any women… 
They didn't have the money? I don't think so go back.  
No, you might maybe get that in the store because average person wouldn't know what fits your rights. 

00:21 
Or maybe I can just write about kind of the whole 

00:24 
Can you tell us how you got into dance? 
But it really was. At that time, it really was. 

00:40 
You had a, you had a an idea in terms of maybe why you weren't discriminated against, partly because  of being an artist, artists. You know, it doesn't matter whether you're black, white or any other color.  There's freedom of expression. And she felt that, 

00:59 
I do. I mean, if you're good, you're good. And you know, a lot of people if they want to learn, and if  they're interested and serious about it, they'll come to you whether you're Japanese or Chinese or  whatever, you know. Well, yeah, different people. No, that's right. I didn't know him at all. 

01:26 
Um, how about you pick up from your story about your father? Cook? 

01:32 
Did I say that before? 

01:33
Yeah. And then after that, I, I guess part of what would be interesting is to get a sense of when you  finally your family finally ended up settling in Pocatello, you were talking about all the various  restaurants and then they finally came here, again, about how old you were in your early childhood  memories. 

01:53 
Which governor was that? I'm not sure. 

01:56 
Anyway, yeah. After we moved to Pocatello, you know, after the depression and all this stuff. Why then  so 

02:01 
So that was a few 30s? Yeah. 

02:06 
Thirty-six.  
What grade?  
I was a sophomore. And the reason, though, well, when I started dancing, most people didn't give their  children dancing in those days anyway. You know. And in Blackfoot, the people who delivered coal and  ice to us in those days, you know, you had coal and ice, you didn't have refrigerators, and freezers.  Well. Their daughter was going to start teaching dancing. And so wanted to know whether my folks  would give me dancing. So my father started giving myself, and my sister dancing. And I always  enjoyed it and loved it, and it came easy for me, so I just kept going with it.  
Was it ballet?  
No, she taught tap and ballet, a little bit of everything. Acrobatic. Now that it's gymnastics more so then  I continued with the dancing, and when I got out of school, my I had worked some and then I went to  Hollywood, and studied there for quite a while. I was at the same studio that Mitzi Gaynor… No, not  Mitzi Gaynor, Shirley Temple, and Deanna Durbin, and Mickey Rooney, and Billy Lee, and Jane Withers. All of those child stars were there at that time. So it was quite interesting to me. And I got to  study with the best I thought at that time. From then on, I just continued and then I came back and  would teach and after I'd teach, I go back to Hollywood, and I'd come back and teach for a while then  I'd go to and I went to Denver for a while, and so on, you know, always ended up coming back for a  while.

04:15 
And you're continuing that right now? 

04:17 
Right, I still do some dancing, teaching.

04:23 
What are some of your early childhood memories of being here in Pocatello? 

04:31 
I don't think I had any special memories, you know, I mean, just nothing. 

04:39 
Do you remember your closest friend back then? 

04:42 
Well, I have two close friends that I went through school with in Blackfoot and over all the years. This  one friend of mine and I have continued sending each other Christmas gifts and it's been Like 40 some  years, and we've never forgotten each other, we've always sent each other something for Christmas.  And then always, after that we'd write each other, thank you for what you know, whatever it was and,  and write a note about what we were doing and so on. And it's really about the only time that I  correspond with her, but it's kind of nice. Then another friend that I have, we corresponded for about 30  years or more. And then she had a few problems. So then it seemed like we just kind of, get didn't, but I  think we've corresponded for over thirty years. 

05:42 
Do you have any brothers and sisters? 

05:44 
I have a sister in Los Angeles, and I had a brother but he passed away, 

05:51 
Was he here? 

05:53 
Here in Pocatello. He worked for Roland dairy for a long time as office manager. 

06:09 
How about you? Why did you come around and 

06:13 
Like around in 1951. And I've been here all my life, I have benefited from not only the tradition of  knowing my grandma, my grandparents on both sides, and I guess cherishing those memories, but  you've also been fostered in in an environment where education was a very key role. And I think that  that's an outstanding element in most Japanese families. But it's not a direct education, so to speak. It's  an application to life, my parents would share going to where we would travel, and it wouldn't matter  whether it was from here to Blackfoot or, or to a foreign country, and they would save up and they  would give my sister and I the benefits of traveling. And they taught us that probably 99% of our  education would come through travel and learning to deal with people in our circumstances. That they were, I guess, smart enough to qualify that statement and say that without a formal education, we'd  never truly be able to appreciate those experiences. So it's been very gratifying to be able to travel with  my parents, and to share some of the experiences as I mentioned in in 1969, when we went to Japan,  my father was an international delegate for the Lions convention there. And it was it was interesting to  to reminisce a part of his childhood. After he finished school in United States, he went to Japan and to  retrace some of those childhood steps and memories with him is something that I'll remember the rest  of my life. The you know, I, I was, 

08:05 
Why don’t you tell some of the stories of your memories? The trash bin, the neighbors? 

08:15 
Well, I always remember and I guess, you know, if I can say one thing from my father and my mother, I  think they have a special ability to, to search out and find a curiosity of life, something that I would love  to be able to learn. That's one of the reasons it's so fun to travel with them because they would  experience and they like to do the common things, the basic things to get off the beaten track from the  tourists, and to go into the rural areas. My father, one day took my mother and I and off the Tokyo  subways and said I remember that this used to be an alley. And right there used to be a trash can. And  we used to climb over this fence and we kept breaking the fence down and so you know this gentleman  was always mad at us but we would run like crazy. And then we would go across this alley and over  that bump and then we would end up at Mr. Saito’s house. And sure enough, we ended up at Mr.  Saito’s house. And it was interesting because as he approached the front door and and he knocked in  gracious little lady came out and, and she knew him by reputation. And it was fascinating to me that  reputation would carry for that many years spanning the war, and never having corresponded with his  old friend, his childhood friend, that they should still be very, very close in touch. 
You know, that evening, they, you know, it's kind of like all of the school children called one another  and, and throughout the village, went from one house to another and we found our ourselves sitting  down at night to a wonderful picnic in one of my father's friend's home, and she made sushi and the  traditional type of food. But it's just been, a been a fascinating learning experience. And I think one of  
the things that, that I didn't really understand until after I was well out of college was, again how to  appreciate and relate interrelate all of these different circumstances. I had a very special relationship  with my with my mother's mother Kito, in that she was well into her 90s when she passed away, and my  grandmother and I, because my, my mother and father, were constantly working during the time we  were being raised, I've spent a great deal of time with my grandmother. And it was always very, very  interesting to sit by her and listen to her recount the stories back in.. She lived through the feudal times,  the samurai era, and, and to hear her reflect upon that tradition and that history. You knew it wasn't just  a story, it was a part of her life. 

11:12 
She has comes from somewhere I roots, right.  

11:15
Yes, yes. You know, I don't know a great deal about that. We, you know, we have part of our family is  starting to research that in, you know, at Hawaii. You know, there are marvelous recounts, back in  1981, there was a spread on the 13th century invasion of khubilai, Khan by Japan and Takasaki. So  Naga, you know, was credited with assisting the repelling of those invasions and through what they call  mosquito tactics. Here were these huge armada of the Mongols coming to shore and, and Takasaki  would take these small little, almost canoe like crafts and go out, and just almost like guerrilla warfare.  But I know my father and my, like, my family has been very, very proud of that tradition.

12:15 
What were some of your early childhood memories? And how did you see the community of Pocatello changing? 

12:22 
It's very interesting, because I've, you know, know, by listening to my mother and my father reflect upon  their experiences, you see one from the very, very tragic side of the war, of utter discrimination to my  mother that was somewhat sheltered from that, because she was born and native to Idaho and  whatnot. And I guess I was at the tail end of that, in most cases, I was very, very well accepted. I think  partly because of performance, partly because of the war was becoming only a memory now. But there  were still those, those families in those groups that still held that deep rooted discrimination. And there  were times when I would come home from school, my sister, Marsha is two years older than I am. And  she was very protective of me and I was very small and frail. And, and she would get mad, sometime  the children would, would call us names and Jap, and whatnot. And, and I was not really old enough to,  you know, have it make any difference to me, but she would get furious, and she would go beat  somebody up, you touch my little brother one more time. And she would, she was fine protector has a  big sister. So I came through a little bit of that there were, you know, areas on Roosevelt Street, one  block from my house, and I would have to walk, I don't know, maybe 10 blocks to where school was,  but there was just the last block. That was the toughest to get through. If I was coming through at night,  I would run and I would, you know, I would just be frightened to death. That was during the day, I knew  I would be hassled during that one block, or, or I'd be fine.  
You know, and that was probably when I was probably, you know, somewhere in the range of nine to  12 years old. And then from about the 12 year old range, things started to change. Then it became  more of a matter of pride, it became a matter of acceptance because of achievement. There was  almost I think, more pressure at that time on not just myself but all of the Japanese. At that time, we  were one of the first classes into Highland high school here. And there weren't as I recall, there weren't  there weren't any other Asians. At the high school. There were two or three of us Japanese. And and  we were always, you know, in in leadership positions in National Honor Society, and so… We really,  were always very athletic. So we didn't really see the the prejudice at that point. The frightening thing  that, that I guess I had to overcome through this, this learning experiences that we were taught, I  guess, to listen, to be very good listeners. And so that was a hard adjustment to try and to fit into  society, because we were probably the shyest people in the class. And I remember being in great  books class one time, my teacher said, you know, 50% of your grade is class participation. And that  was the first day. So I went up, you know, about two weeks later, just knowing I was failing the course.  And I said, I says, I really don't want to flunk this course. But I can't talk. And so I would not raise, right my hand, I said, I will do term papers, I will do anything you want me to do, but I will not talk. And it was  really funny when I went to, to illustrate this point of how shy that we were, of how content we were to  listen. And then to input through other means very creatively.  When, when I enrolled at the University of Colorado, my parents, of course, came down to Boulder to  help me enroll there. Because we're going down the freeway, to Boulder towards Denver, we passed  the signs at Colorado State University. And we kept passing signs at Colorado State University. And I still didn't know that there was a difference between the two, when we finally decided just to keep  going. And we finally made it to the University of Colorado. And during freshman orientation, the first  two days, I went through all the lines, and I put all the x's in the right boxes. And I finally, you know, got  to the head of the line to where I was supposed to hand the lady my cards and come to find out that I've  been carrying these cards around and doing all these these systematic things for two days. And I was  matriculating for my cousin, who is is a girl one. And that was very embarrassing, of course. And so I  had to go back to the end of the line and come back on but that was how shy that we were. 

17:20 
You have a sister? Do you have any other brothers and sisters? 

17:23 
No. Just like my sister, 
Where is Marsha? 
Marsha is up in Seattle. And she works on computers with Boeing. 

17:33 
What were your early memories interacting with Marsha besides her being protective? 

17:38 
Well, she was she was both my protector and my greatest adversary. And I think that that's where I  guess all generations and all races come together. She would protect me on the one hand and she gets  so furious with me. And she, I always remember she she once, one time said that that is not right. And  you know, you're not going to do it. And she picked me up and she threw me into the wall. And I still  have this great big goose egg right here. And ever since I remember, you know, I just remember that  and I would never hit hit my sister. And I love her very dearly. And I just remembered that that very  satisfying day when I grew up. And she was so mad at me and I held her hands. And she said she  wanted to hit me she wanted to kick me and about all she could do after this was cry. So I says fine. 

18:28 
One question I'd like all of you to answer. It's a two part question. Hang on a second, Jeff, because  we've got about a minute left on this tape so it's changed. Okay, so that we have plenty to think about
