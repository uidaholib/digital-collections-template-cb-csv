00:03 
The following is an interview with Mr. DOMA studio by Angela Luckey. The interview took place in Mr.  Munoz home, seven Wilwood Avenue Pocatello, Idaho, on May 13 1991, this interview is part of the  Idaho Hispanic oral history project.

00:25 
So we can talk a little bit 

00:32 
Do you know when your family came to this country 

00:35 
using 1970 or 1980, but I can't remember, I should have gotten in touch with my sister. But she's, as far  as I know, she's still in California. And that's as close as I can come. And how did they come? They  came by they started by a wagon pulled by mules and horses, which open wagon designer said they  went from my north of LA to San Francisco. And they took a train there, San Francisco to Susanne  Flores and crossed over to El Paso on foot. And then from there, they were loaded onto a train that was  there by reaching the new title food company looking for workers to work in their big fields of an idle so  they were hired, they're loaded on the training came to light by trained as the mode of travel that they use

02:06 
to watch training Listen, 

02:07 
Nina, no, I have no idea. I'm sure there was a change of train somewhere because they'll pass on it. I  hope it's maybe sad for you in the Southern Pacific and come up into this country they must come  through Denver and then change strains come they must come here buddy and Pacific from Denver.  I've traveled around myself during the war that's the way I remember the trades 

02:49 
Was it difficult for them to immigrate at that time? 

02:52 
No, no, as I understand that, it was easy because of the need for workers in the fields here at that time.  The United States waiting in Europe

03:11 
or one and they needed field workers as well as I'm sure in other in other fields, they needed workers  and so as today it's very convenient and cheap source labor. People with Mexico supplied 

03:40 
so they experienced no difficulty they that time they didn't even have passports they had but they did  have some kind of an entry paper that I've seen where the pictures of the family and a sample on it. So  that was probably pretty simplified. As I say the same situation existed during World War One as  existed in World War Two they needed people. This country needed people to work harvesting crops  that put American people's food on the table. So it was it was convenient and maybe it was made easy  for them. They didn't apparently didn't have quarters as in. 

04:38 
Do you remember your grandparents? 

04:40 
No, I never knew them at all. I have pictured my father his mother. And that's I've never seen a picture  of Mother grandparents. I remember when I remember that my mother's father I when I was small,  because I remember seeing that letter of notifications, bordered in black. I guess I was accustomed in  those days. But I did not know any. 

05:16 
Did anybody else come with a family when they can? 

05:18 
Yeah, I had an uncle Joe and cousin, Nikolas. Nick. Come later. They came with family, teenage guys  at the time. They're both dead. For those whose two came that I know of. And I'm sure that some of the  ones well, I mean, my sister, sister and two older brothers, of course. 

05:54 
So your uncle's left with you during this? 

05:57 
Both my uncle and my cousin lived with us. Laters. Who lived in Mr. curios house over there. And know  when we moved a couple of houses over a third. Nick was still living in my uncle's late to this day. That  was until he got married. 

06:27 
So they all came to Idaho. At that time, 

06:30 
yeah. I'm among the seven that all of them did. I know. I'm sure a lot of them. My cousin Nick, not. He.  He got over into Wyoming's at some time and lived with him. He joined yesterday, all warmed up here  the Savior is all saved here.

07:00 
We're saying the very first time they came to Idaho, which 

07:03 
Blackfoot? They came to Blackfoot. From the Blackfoot. They went to Aberdeen and I guess from  Aberdeen to Salt Lake because they came here from Salt Lake. And those are the places and you were  born here. Yeah. Yeah. I know they're born when after they came from Salt Lake. 

07:43 
What type of work did your dad do? 

07:48 
He worked on the road. He had made two previous trips on the family still in Mexico. And I only know of  him working on the railroad. His first trip took him to the Chicago area. And the second trip took him to  the California. San Joaquin Valley. Yeah, he worked there. Now. He may have worked in the field fields  there. But I don't know this. Anyway, those are two places that he had worked. So someone was sitting  in the railroad and most of the time. On railroad, he was a laborer. And he spent most of his railroad  career infotel working for the Union Pacific in stores department as a scraps or in the material yard. 

08:57 
When was that during World War 

08:59 
Two? Well, no, no, it started back there. I'm not sure what year he started. I'd have to guess about the  year before I was born. And until he retired in 1964. So he spent the better part of four years 

09:29 
what is the scrap sort of do? What is the scratch? 

09:33 
What they said in use material? Well, he worked in material guard and among other things, they they  stored new material such as new rails and stuff like that. And also there came there used materials  which had to be sorted out as to what was usable and what was scrapped. So that was what they're I  work consistently. 

10:04 
I've been your mother. She's been home. 

10:06 
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. My mother had more than her hands. Raising seven kids and my father. So if you  know, in those days, that's what it was. Anyway, you didn't hear too much about women, wives going  on and working. Leaving the kids home alone. That's that was unheard of, in those days.

10:32 
Did your sisters go stay with her? Or did they do some work? 

10:38 
Well, my older sister worked a lot she, she worked out in the field with us. And later on, after she got  older, she worked as made for some people here in town, and also at the bank Hotel. So she was very,  but my younger sister, she, you know, she would when she graduated from high school, different  places here. And remember, she worked classes, but most of the time she worked at the hospital, and  later worked for some doctors. In an office job, sometimes 

11:29 
you branch 

11:31 
Well, as a mom and brothers worked out in fields and went to school. And later, they in 1937, and went  to work on the railroad at the free house. And so didn't have to work out in fields anymore. But they got  enough of when they're younger, they were very hard. And eventually, my oldest brother, sometime  after my mother died, he left the study electronics after the war. And then after I'd moved to California,  he then pulled up stakes and went to California to to work with electronics technician. But my other  older brothers stayed here on the railroad. My youngest brother stayed on the railroad but the in  between brother between my youngest and me, Lois. He also gone to school aeronautical school in  Oklahoma and became a meteorologist. And we left here same day, in 1956. He went to North Carolina  to California, and he's moved from North Carolina. Well, he was working here No father, my mother  died and then he went to North Carolina and he went to Arizona. And from Arizona, you went to El  Paso 

13:23 
Why did your family come here? 

13:26 
Why did they come in? Well, because my father had become involved in the in a matter of that the the  owner of last end of it that town was built on. had it in for my father because my father who apparently  in there do well, he claimed my older sister he was here and like to work. And he liked to drink and  gamble. And I guess that it didn't go over too well with that guy that owned the time and seeing that by  noon. Don't drop mode and beyond. And very conveniently when once this is all green revolution has  been at revolute banned the revolutionary came to the town and raises and raises the hill and among  those guy who was a friend of my father's and somebody saw that guy. And after they left that report,  when my friends my father's friends had been involved in that bunch that raided the town and so  naturally, it followed my father had to be in cahoots with them. So that was all that guy needed to have  my father arrested and he was thrown in jail. Fortunately, that night before he he was to be shot by  another revolutionary band, right in town, and they opened the doors in jail and my brother got up. And  he came United States. And that's when he went to the Chicago area. And he stayed a period of time. I  don't know what the time was. He stayed a period of time, then he went back to Mexico to see if it was  safer to go back. And apparently, it was not safe. So he came back the United States, it's time to pick California. Then after a period of time, he went back again and see if he could save for him. And no, it  was not safe for him. So that's what he brought to the family. And they came to the United States. 

15:54 
At that time it was with your sisters. How many family members came just your mom and your dad? 

16:01 
Well, the three kids my older sister, my two older brothers, and my uncle and cousins and my mother.  Yeah, that'd be seven. Yeah, my brothers were small. The one those libertarians, I guess, maybe a  couple of years old. Probably a year or 

16:33 
when you worked at a field, did you live in the farmer provide? 

16:39 
In that one year that I remember, and I'm not sure what year it was, but it was about 1929. We did live  up on the farm on Chubbuck road. And I don't know if it was the same year or the following year we've  lived on the farm where the ordinance plant is located. We live there. And I I'm pretty sure that it was  two different years. But I don't know what years they were in Euless, the one of the one on the class  form was a little check to room house check ins to my house. But now is it's unbelievable night. I went  last year with my niece. Sure What are we learned? Because their mother, mild sister was up there with  us and the house over here where the ordinance plan is now i i can't remember now with houses like  but it was like living in the park because actually part of that farm was rented out as a picnic area. So it  feels pretty nice out there. And with torches, it was it was pretty good. I don't remember that we felt that  we were living in poverty because I mean, we're supplied with milk and aids from the farm and apples  and things like that. My father took time off, he was still employed on the railroad, he was really lucky  because when the Depression came me, he was laid off for a while but not very long. And so when he  wanted to take this out there, I guess there was a need for extra money, of course. So he took time off  and around. I don't remember what they called it. It wasn't vacation. But there's something similar to  that. And then go ahead and take us out there to work and when it's over, came back and come back to  John on the railroad. So I the conditions that I found in California when I went there and field workers  was not nearly as good as the conditions and we were under here. In 1932 1934 1936, I worked in  Drake outside of drinks in the P fields. And at that time, those people came from California and this was  in the depths of the depression. They came from California to Idaho to work so that either there wasn't  too much work at that time in California or the working conditions were better here than it was in that  time. Him iversity code. Yeah, those three years that I spent in Greg's working out when people came  here to work with In California, there was one Texas family. And the rest of them were from Colorado.  And Utah and Idaho. 

20:11 
Nebraska. 

20:13
No, I don't remember if there might have been but I don't remember from Nebraska. But those states  that I remember, yeah, one family from Texas and people from Colorado lose money. They call it from  Utah. I don't know. And, you know, a few families from hearing Portello in 1932 have done families and went from here. To there, there were several people, several families from Idaho Falls there, that were  there, too. At that time, I wasn't aware that there were my scissors, but they were 1932. Later on, some  kids live here. And I found that they were born outside of I don't flowers. It's probably times where there  are very many Mexicans and Mexicans around here. Well, I, I think I think that at that time, they were  probably as many as there are now. But I mean, the fact that they were able to organize a social cloud,  the groups are sold, I think it was called Yeah. And they held 

21:43 
stage presentations. It made dances for the 16th, September and different May. And people do made  speeches. And there were musical presentations, the people who played for the dancers were all  mixing musicians from potel. So 

22:21 
I'm, I make the judgment that there were quite a few people here to support that kind of activity. 

22:29 
That was in the 30. I was gonna 30 

22:32 
Yeah, the late 20s. And the 30s 3030s it all in and when the Depression came in, so many were laid off  on the road, and that broke it all up. But in order to sustain that kind of social activity, there has to be  quite a number of people to get a bang, for example, the play for our dances. And the speakers are all  good speakers as I can remember even though I'm smile, I've always zeroed in on that kind of stuff.  And yeah, they were there a considerable, considerable number of people from my school around here.  And they weren't that 

23:25 
we even had one year we even had classes in Spanish. In school, well, no, I'm talking about her. Yeah.  And I went to I was proud of the dummy. I'm always willing to spell real well in English, but I remember  that I had my troubles in Spanish, but you know, I was only maybe six, seven years old eight at the  most. But yeah, we had classes in Spanish I don't know who the man was. I kind of think my  impression is the guy was just stayed here for a while short period of time. I know he wasn't one of the  permanent residents here. But so again, you know, there there must have been a considerable number  of reasons here to sustain that kind of back to this crazy call me dad. My father was some type of  Officer of that club because when I broke up, we wound up with a bunch of books that were sent by the  Mexican government. I still had one of them downstairs. I came too late. into this idea of saving of  having books, or having my own library. So I wasn't able to salvage one, no to two kinds of books. Well,  one of them is kind of a primary reader. And the other one is a technical book on shooting really just, I  mean, I'm amazed because when I went to work at IBM, why one of the things that I had learned  because nobody else wanted to do it was to do sheetmetal work. And here I find, like, magic keep this  book in its own sheet, sheet metal fabrication in Spanish. It's been interesting to me that I should have that demo, from my experience, my job, but they were some of the others that I remember. Kind of it's  not very common propaganda that any government puts out literature, telling them, the type of  improvements and the advancements and things like that the one that I remember had to do with  maybe agriculture or water preservation something along those lines that I remember the table of  others 

26:28 
those books there, man, that that chart, was he the one that brought those? No, no, 

26:32 
they were sent to the to that club. That group says hula matures. Blue Cross translates to Blue Cross. 

26:45 
And your dad was one of the officers. Yeah, yeah. Do you remember who was president? Remember  anyone who was president? 

26:59 
No, I don't know another man. Very intelligent man on let's see, Soto. He was appointed officers in the  cloud. He's only one I can remember 

27:16 
how Mexicans treated around here. In those days, well. 

27:25 
Bye by and large, I think there was what discrimination or prejudice there there was here wasn't too  apparent because we Mexicans socialized among ourselves, as I say with the social club. Like I  mentioned, they made dances and there were always weddings and baptisms. And even the weeks for  funerals, why they all were social activities. For example, the dances, what the heck I mean, I'm a lover  of music. And certainly we had the music to dance to which meant that we didn't have to go to try to get  into the actual dances where we went wrong. Anyway, we knew that but it didn't make any difference.  Because what did we need from them in the way of social activities when we had our own which were  those nice is theirs. And food was served that Mexican food and music was Mexican women were  Mexican. So what the hell did we need from them? But certainly the the discrimination and prejudice  existed in housing and jobs. Yeah, I myself, turned down for two jobs total very explicitly, because as a  Mexican, couldn't have those jobs. Refused entrance into the YMCA, swimming pool, even though my  father and all the rest of railroad employees contributed something like $1 $2 a month to the subsidy in  that YMCA. And those kinds of things. One of the one of the things that are so funny to me is even now,  in 1932, when I went to drinks to pick pizza I remember the one one of them mentioned they recently  dances on Saturday nights are in Greg's the Mexican state. But remember that American girls would go  to Mormon communities. The girls would go Oh, but they wouldn't dance with the Mexicans. You see,  they would dance with the Filipinos. Always in those camps, the Filipinos came from California to see.  And they always dressed real flashy, you know, they always had the newest cars because maybe four  or five guys would shipping by Ben Cardin and they've always they've always dressed real fine. Those  guys and so the American girls would dance with them but they wouldn't with Mexicans and I thought it was funnier now until the ladder year that our 1936 that assimilation began to take place because  inevitably the end of the PCs and why there would be at least one American girls in takeoff California  and Mexico. In 19, COVID-19 de vos calm glad to Linden What the hell is allowing us okay, looking  back on it I thought it was funny 

31:09 
Well, when you when you family, my shopping when things sharp, I mean, 

31:15 
well, we shot but the shopping I remember what the hell JCPenney. It began here in this area, what  green room and I can remember JC Penney from my earliest childhood there was Mr. Q US stores and  somehow or another he's Italian he he glommed on to the knowledge that these people needed special  type of food 

32:02 
items. 

32:04 
Oh, you imported Mexican food? Yeah. 

32:06 
Yeah. Because don't start in Thailand with the help. But see, he was knowledgeable about it. And he,  he made quite a bit of money from the medicines. I remember him delivering groceries not only our  place, I'd been playing inside the searching fence we call the safety fence, the real authentic wooden  fence all the way from First Street and Clark again. Then came all the way down here to our stop Street  will only the railroad yards and inside the fence Mexicans lived in those houses from wioth to Lennar  inside the real property. And there's a row of houses a row of apartments I should say. And I think four  families live there. And then at each end are on the south in there was a big house and a couple of  families and then north and broad farms. A family lived there and then a Greek guy and then there was  another small house north of that right close to Florida. So in there all those Mexicans ready they are  shocked at Mr. Qu store. And so we had regular deliveries there and I remember the first pickup truck  that I can remember all metal is one of the sons who would help him do it. And the rest of them like the  Eastern store and block store. They're the only ones I remember. I'm sure at least one store headline  Mexican trade deals there on its side. Between the first and second one, Senator sweet because I  remember going there and that was going back that far in any training that my high school years blocks.  My family used to treat Do you Jeremie configured for one maximum family goals versus country? And  then it wasn't happens, you know, talking about the Mexican people here back in the 20s. For example,  there was a there was a quiet pool hall. It was located on first and Louis crust from the fried house and  it was A man across the street across Lewis from South St. Louis, who's that roar that complex of  wooden rooms it was the red light area. And that was on the west side. And then on the Bonneville side  of that block was this row of apartments. It was all of those apartments are rented by bachelor mansion,  guys. And what I started to say right there, on the corner was was pool and going from that's the south  end. 100. South first, going back to Center Street. And then across the street. going north on first there  were there was a barber shop. There was an excellent. And I think I'm not sure. But there might have been a little Mexican restaurant, the body schoolhouse and a restaurant. It was a pool restaurant, too.  Since that was during Prohibition courses, losing any money, but there is no, there are no Mexicans in  this town, who would at least sustain those two businesses? 

36:45 
So most people trade for the other Mexicans trade in? 

36:49 
Oh, yeah, sure. So to date, of course, that's, that's not true. I'm talking those days why? It was a sense  of the traded order. They were treated the best and where they had where the stock was merchandise  that was sold was maybe in their price range. And styles that they liked in particular. But yes, I  remember that diesel store, it was clothing store. Going there quite often. 

37:33 
Somebody told me that that you knew, or that the Chinese are living around here and about the  Chinese. That sunlight seems to me somebody told me that you knew about the Chinese and well, 

37:48 
I know. I know something about the Chinese and the Japanese. I was closer to, to the Japanese. But  yes, right there in that area, North first. Football was a private company is now North first. And around  the corner on center. There were several Chinese restaurants. When I say seven, there might have  been three. But then farther across the alley on center going east on center day was the Keystone  Cafe, which was Chinese and of course the Shanghai Cafe is still better, that's Chinese. And I think  there's one on South first Chinese, probably between Phoenix and the Goddess. But then on second,  nor Second, there were Chinese. In fact, there was there were quite a few Chinese living I remember  them very well with quite a few Chinese. And then 

39:00 
kitty corner from where all those guys were was another bunch of Chinese and in fact, when they tore  down the column, I think they call it flat iron building something like that. That rosary used to run along.  Hotel, the second 100 Block going north. By Chinese lived there was brick buildings. They were torn  down or remember we used to get a big charge on looking at all the dams, tunnels that were in under  those brick buildings and of course, we're from the smell of food and shoot time we could we could  imagine all kinds of things. buildings. They they stayed on into right up to the world up to World War  Two because they were running the law Freeze, right there in that one building that was on the corner.  Clark and second was in second. So right up until the end of World War Two. Those guys were still in  business there. And I had and I had one friend that worked, I think Keystone, Petco, when he came, he  came forward telling you, he had to go to school, go to school to go to school. And I mean, he was big  for us, but he didn't know how to learn how to speak English. So get started with first grade and then he  was tiring, me and my, my big mouth. I used to hear the white kids calling people those guys chinks.  ching, ching chong or something like that. And I remember my big boss, Winston, Lee him hitting me.  But after that, I learned several of the things that you didn't say. Like was the blacks to you know, you  learn very, very early that you don't say certain things, even if you are stupid. And yeah, Lee Lee and I  became good friends and big guy. Yeah, and I guess because of the Keystone and the Shanghai there continues to be Chinese. Guys, they're in that area on the side of I know, my youngest brother had a  Chinese friend too. But they, they were mostly here because of those restaurants. And there were no  women. You know, that exclusion? left them out. And all those the Japanese, you know, their Japanese  girls and went to the Bonneville school over they were with us. I don't know how that came about.  Because the Exclusion Act was a thing too. But yeah, I had a lot of Japanese friends to 

42:15 
see you were talking about you went to Bible school. Can you tell me about your school? Life? Speak  English when you went to school? 

42:26 
I know I doubted because I guess I hadn't learned in there. You know, I can't remember that far back.  But I know what the heck at home, we spoke Spanish and my father saved him saying that no, no. You  don't speak English in this house. You know, well spoken. Why not in the house? What's going on  winning Chris Green. I have no idea how much. I couldn't have known very much English if I had I, you  know, as explosive because they're black kids around us and the Greeks and Italians and so in the  Indian, so the French. So that, so English was spoken in the neighborhood but not, not before I got into  the school. 

43:20 
wouldn't make sense. And is that where you went to elementary school? Yes. 

43:25 
Well, and no, the last year which would have been I think the fourth or fifth grade we were we were  bused were sent to Washington School. Because apparently the mind was school was filled. And so  there we go. Money to Mexican kids and black kids and Chinese kids, Greek kids and Italian kids. All  this great mixture that we have at the moment we had to go to the Washington, Washington and his  lawyer, the lawyers and college professors, doctors, kids went to school. I guess we're forced upon that  school and remember Mrs. Krause condoms the principal saying she didn't want to do we're forced we  were not welcomed. I was talking about culture shock and it was it was pretty rough at first but I love  that and I cannot be get pretty good good grades in case of the cheats taught and so she thinks she  looked with favor on me. She was she 

44:49 
was hostile to me if you're interested guys. How that most schools are Really any car make sure  nationalities and colors and all that stuff I know this is unusual for this part of the country after all 

45:18 
this is more of a country at that time Mormons were all white and there we were that that school over  there was just anything to name and it was so unusual that one year Mr. Springs in principle put  together a radio program musical everybody sing songs, countries, they are their parents California  became quite popular. Go around from civic clubs to churches putting on that program so it was highly  unusual.

46:01 
Can you sing a song? Yeah. 

46:04 
Friend of mine man read at night. He's dead. We say something I don't remember what it was and  Socorro Ernestine red. So God rose morning. And they sang the song No, she just sang a song by  herself solo, La Paloma represent Spanish 

46:38 
kids saying Japanese, Chinese and German are also going like this. But that was that was indicative of  how, what an unusual school. There were I don't remember any incidents of racial problems. With the  exception of one time a guy told me that I couldn't drink out of the fight more than the other kids were  making. Because I mentioned that. I seem to remember he was an older guy. What he was doing on  the school grounds would be on me and I think he is trying to be smarter like I don't. But certainly in that  school there was no I saw no distinction at all made by the teachers. I think that was quite unusual.  Also, those teachers shouldn't be so fair minded. After all, it was not coming to have that many different  types of kids. People of any kind in one school in this area. Because yeah, I certainly remember that.  Mrs. Woods. This is what's great big gold wedding band, why we used to live in her class. She'd come  down and shoot money on the head with that thing. I can still feel that way. Going through my head but  you I mean, there was no there was no favoritism in class. If you misbehave didn't matter what kale you  were as far as the color of skin when she laid that thing. And she taught this I think she taught  everybody in my in my family including her older sister. Classes very well liked lady 

48:43 
Where did you go to high school? 

48:45 
Hotel High School? That's all there was. That that was quiet. To me. It was an experience I think I  explained to everybody but there were only two or two of those Mexicans in that class of Alexander's  Ernestine graduating that same class again, there was well I've seen her iron the scenes pictures in my  yearbook of her being a member a couple of as far as position that I belong to that week to this day.  And so I I take pride in associate in any social activities and I cried football, but as to smile, I get the hell  out of me or I don't feel I still have my shoulders broken. Broken but I surely spent a whole year  payment because it was now 1981 It finally flared up and caused me a lot of Pain. I was I said, I  weighed 127 pounds and in my senior year and I I couldn't do couldn't do as well as I would have liked  to in football anyway. But I took part in intramural sports, they had their social activities of course, like  all high school, but I wasn't a part of it. I was I suppose I was living a dual life. Then just like I did later  by the end with it pick. During the day I was a student with all that I chose and after school was over, I  became a Mexican. That's through my high school I didn't I didn't I didn't automatically draw from  Mexico. Quite I had quite a few like friends. Only one of them I socialize with the house. But the rest of  them I didn't know I was not enough cast. I had a lot of friends when it was guys. This guy Steve  Meisner, who's who is a justice Supreme Court we're good friends. Even after after we did US Army  was very friendly to me. Well, we had reason to wait because I've saved him from getting these but not  death by a guy who's a first grader slugging come by and I was a friend of the guy that was going to 
slowly mean he's big guy was rough, rough mix. Steve was meant to be a fighter. Anyway, I talked the  guy out of fighting with Steven so after that, you know SeaWorld remember? We're really good friends.  Last time I thought, but no, I was not a part of the social activities of hooked in high school. 

52:25 
Back bad What's her number? What did Mexican kids have opportunities to hold offices cheerleader for 

52:34 
at that time? I can't I can't say that because I'm wrong. There's only 12 Was there now. I think that let's  see Julia surdo was a freshman anyway, hopefully sophomores I don't remember any No, I don't  remember any in the junior class. So there were so few of us that 

53:10 
we would have had to been outstanding to have been very much I think there was no real barrier to to  becoming a school class officer, but as I say, I don't think there was any barrier in some forums  because of discrimination prejudice. I don't think it was there. The Japanese were certainly very highly I  mean, very intelligent kids and I went to school with Japanese and I think only later where they they're  the girls are very shy. Japanese girls shy. So I can't remember that any of those guys held any office in  high school. 

54:19 
Did you go to college? 

54:22 
I went to college after the war after I finished my apprenticeship when I decided to try for a engineering  degree. And I did it by going to by working at night before to 12 shift and going to school in a day and I  was only able to attend for two semesters. They the not the nightshift out at the gunfight or I was  working in that I had you Go back to working days. And so I had to drop out after those two semesters. 

55:11 
And after that was when I had to find a job someplace where I could continue my education. And I knew  this plan was going to close. So I knew I had to be current in order to do it. And I came up with the idea  of going to work for the government, or already working for the government in Spain, where the Air  Force and the Navy were building bases, and also trying to get a job at Los Alamos. And the fourth  choice I had was to go to California. Well, well, someone was they kept putting me off and putting me  off. They would. They would try and get me 

56:02 
to care for a cup of coffee. I got an appointment to counsel, I'm going to go get this book of stuff. You  know, these kids go in those trucks going boom, boom. Well, look at you, Mr. Marty. Does she say you  get there by her? 

56:21
No, she doesn't. She thinks everybody loves her. So by I tried to get on with the Air Force to Hillfield  Nandan. They said no, everybody wants to go to Spain to work for the government. And resides that in  these political connections I had the Navy said you got to know somebody got a politician Well, door  shack and that other guy they were. I mean, I was political enough time for them to know me and I was  Democrat anyway, they're Republican. So anyway, I didn't get to go to spring with either one of them  and was almost never did that. Come up with a vibrator. So it's California and went to the Los Angeles  area, the first Indiana place that I applied for jobs, they offered me one as a machinist. I already  graduated from the printing school here. But I had already contacted IBM recruiter by phone. He wasn't  going through. He was in Salt Lake at the time. And so he sent me a application. And I told him, I was  going to California and said, Well, you can send vy stop it and talk to him. So I did. After I left Los  Angeles, San Jose, and by luck I we checked into a hotel, it was just a block from IBM. Development.  Rachel for IBM and I, we've been up all night and I decided not to go to bed and go ahead and first  thing as soon as they opened up in tech, seven, so I went over there and yeah, they were already  opened and they sent me to personnel. That time IBM scattered all over assembling. They sent me all  the personnel or by were lucky that their personnel officers and I asked them if they were hiring  machines, and they said no. So I started to walk out of there and a lady called me back and asked me if  I worked on machines like lathes and milling machines. I told her Yeah. She said, Would you like to try  for modelmaker jobs? And I said, Well, I'm not sure I know. Model makers do but if they worked on that,  yeah, but she arranged an interview with me with a guy, they're in personnel, and they arranged for  three other interviews in different parts of town. Then they told me they would get in touch with me. But  I had a peek at one of the papers, one of the guise of saying the same that you recommend the writing  the code. So yeah, I came back in the week I got a letter from him telling me there why we've got to  work with them. So that's what I have to do. Got to work with IBM. And actually, it was she's the one  that made this tune because I wanted to work in Lac I've been really great and warm Jews. Out there, I  just like it, it was different than my god restaurants, all kinds of Mexican restaurants on the side, it was  our great food, oh, and music and the dancers and the beautiful girls and I feel no place. But when it  came time when she didn't like, so she, she made the decision that we should go to San Jose. So that's  how we wound up. And it was a great decision maker. Which a big difference in my life. 

1:00:40 
I guess amount of making 

1:00:41 
a money maker is just a machinist. Who, who differs only in that he has to be able to make parts  without a formal blueprint or drawing. A Yes, mommy dress B will make parts just by oral instructions or  just with a sketch. And there's a reason for it don't because they only have them in research and  development. They don't have him in manufacturing, in manufacturing and come tool makers and  machines you see. But in the mug shot there. The word model in that case means that you're making  the first part, the model part. They don't know if it's going to work or not. Whatever mechanism it's going  to be using. So that's why they use the word model. And other than that, use the same machines.  Everything is the same other than that. But as you go along, you soon learn that the other differences  that exist is that you have to be able to respond real fast to the engineers needs. As a model maker,  you work on a team and that team is composed of a couple of engineers and an electronics technician  and designer that way, and whatever they decide that they need meat they need to be made. That's what you're there for, you're going to select the materials, put on the machine and make it so it requires  accuracy beyond which I was used to work over here and didn't have a blueprint to study to see how  the mix. So and I had the least amount of experience when I went there. And so it was just it was really  tough on me. I never had an affinity for machine, even here as an apprentice side. Apprentice machine  and still only another guy in high. School doing the day we walked in there. I know what the first day is  going to be pushed to work isn't a printing mask. My father asked me what I was going to do. And I  couldn't tell because I didn't have explained this idea. On the other hand, the other 58 Guys, they all  had done some kind of machine, whether it serves services or on the railroad. They might have been  machinists helpers, the southern Mexican guy, well he had 

1:03:55 
but he knows that he wasn't really one sort of knee deep busted back to the beginning as an  apprentice. And I struggled off to friendship, just because I just didn't have a knack for it. But the thing  that came through is a real good apprenticeship. We were three weeks sharp in one week of the month  we spent in the classroom. 

1:04:23 
And in the classroom we studied graphing sharp math history English to get the other. So anyway, I did  very well 

1:04:47 
in the classroom so I made it through because of the day. But otherwise, I like to be having real  bandwidth Um, you know, very isolated, you know, I'd work against guys that already before the war  had worked. In the Army or the Navy, most of them that are mostly Navy in the Air Force because  they're so technologically oriented. So I had, I had a tough in there and then I go into working on the  model shop. They're all Hotshots. They're up against that again. 

1:05:38 
seem to Okay. Well, when the guy told me once that if he'd have been there, when I went through, he  would never hire me. Later on the way he told me was that I was never reimbursed model has gotten 

1:06:05 
very interesting by the fact that I would study capitalism. None of the rest of guys are so that as you 

1:06:16 
How do you feel about education? 

1:06:20 
Well, I feel very strongly about education. I mean, it's, it's, to me, it's the real ideal to be educated. But  when I say educated, I don't mean to just get a degree from the University complex. That doesn't mean.  I mean, I liked I liked liberal arts, education, better than technical terms, such as engineering, because  after spending 21 years in engineering, I'm not 20 years in engineering. I know how badly those guys  need to get in touch with people. I mean, when you when you consider that they don't have to even  have a good knowledge, working knowledge and things English language, to be able to spell to be able 
to write a line, let alone a paragraph that only knows what they do in there. I have to write a term paper.  Well, I don't they do that one guy. I wrote his term paper for him in a mindset of thing. And he was a  senior in San Jose State, going through a degree in electrical engineering later on. I mean, I did a lot of  technical writing for him. It was too hard to try and work from, from that. Stuff that those other engineers  had written, they just know. I mean, I know from my experience here, I 

1:08:19 
I know how, how hard things is to ask people for guidance, high school 13 years, and to get the second  highest grade on entrance examination over here. Why? No, there's a lot of guys with lower grades and  you shouldn't be that way. And yeah, when we took the entrance examination, English entrance  examination over here, in our pressure program to determine at what level we would want to be taught  English, I got the highest grade to play places there. And all I'm saying is, it's, there's a lot of people  with low training degrees are not. To my mind, they're not really educated. They, they're going to be  engineers, and that's how they're going to make money. They're going to be wheels, and I don't I don't  think too much. I think engineers if they're that smart should be should know something about the  outside world. Rather than just bringing home a paycheck. That's education. Yeah. But I also feel  training for those who don't, who are not really attuned to it to the college life. There has to be more  emphasis put on that because you don't have to be a college graduate to make good money. Before in  order to live in this country. I mean, after all these entitlement programs came to pass because of the  civil rights movement. And I know that our brothers there in San Jose running around three pieces with  a degree in their hand, and they make payments as far as ways, but not less good. I mean, they'll be  walking down First Street in San Jose with a three piece suit in the middle of the day, and everybody  knows you have an office job, but what is it pays? Money isn't everything either. But for all we have to  earn our cert to human beings, and I certainly think I did. Okay. By not getting a degree. Even though I  didn't get a degree and I think, well, I did as well as love the guy whose degrees I could I could have  done. I don't say better, because that's what I'm talking about. In most places becoming managers  supposed to be. That's the ultimate, and I don't care for that I absolutely didn't. After I learned what they  had to go through. 

1:11:30 
I was I was only the way a lot of people knew that. 

1:11:36 
Like people thought I was stupid with a lot of people knew that. I had done myself pretty, pretty good  favor by saying cars often job. That wasn't, it wasn't for me, I wouldn't have lasted 24 hours as a  manager. I didn't have the stomach for it. And I was very happy to see the letter that gets 

1:12:12 
back to your family. I just want to know a bit about the relationship with the family. Was that? Who was  the boss and who did the discipline? 

1:12:25 
Oh, my mother, my mother, she was a boss. And she sure discipline me. And so I had her no. I don't  know about her discipline. My older brother. Certainly, me. And I'm sure my younger brothers on go. I don't remember them being disciplined. And I'm sure they were. I know that I was. I mean, I recognize  that. The reason I won because I probably use it pretty well. There's no question that I wasn't an angel.  I wasn't, I mean, I wasn't a thief or our drunkard or god forbid, little part because people just didn't do  that. Only bachelors did that. It wasn't the kind of stuff Oh, I remember, in high school a guy used to go  to school with he'd come by we go to school together and we stopped behind this place where the  Chinese guys lived and we smoke a cigarette We're bound for prediction during the sale and because  of that. So but no, my mother and father were I suppose moderately strict. And so there were certain  things that I was not allowed to do. So just stay out after 10 o'clock and always let him know where I will  be going and when I didn't do that then I'm 

1:14:13 
done. They different curfews for the girls. 

1:14:17 
Well, my I don't remember that. See my older sister was off. I mean, she's quite a bit more than about  19. Seven, that would be about 15 years for me. So you so I didn't know about that. And I wasn't  around when my younger sister was in her teens group I was in the army. I don't remember that kind of  stuff. Things will be a whole lot different than that. So we're faced with all of that out things that young  women are faced with today. I mean, you talk about drugs, abortion, that kind of stuff, that kind of stuff. 

1:15:14 
So your mom didn't go with your beautiful girl, she went with your sisters on their dates or whatever. 

1:15:20 
Oh, no. No, I mean, dating was another matter to you know, you didn't. I mean, all of the cases that I  can remember, I remember one guy left some flowers at our doorstep, front doorstep. I didn't know who  he was, I knew that he'd like my older sister. But in so many cases, they're the girls in order to get  married and had to elope with the guys, you know? Sure. You're fairly and faster, sir, that they did a  couple of on site experience did just that 

1:16:06 
way. They didn't come and ask 

1:16:08 
for their hands or anything. No, because they were so intransigent. Like the Gonzales grills out my, my  godfather lives in. In LA, now he had a move with his wife Bester. But he told me once, one time they  were I think there were three of them. And they are upgrading back in the wars in front of guns. I was  hoping they can help me they're on tack or Wilson when was and this was night. And all of a sudden  from from the dark emerge restroom on service with a gun. Ask them what their business is. Don't get  lost. You know, that kind of thing? 

1:16:57 
It was Henry Gonzalez. Is there

1:17:00 
anything so always his grandfather? No. 

1:17:07 
Some motion remember? Oh, 

1:17:10 
yeah, hell yeah. Most of them. Got Yes. Oh, I remember when my older sister told my mother, she's  gonna get married. Oh, my God. And I remember when my uncle may go in and gunsights. Girl, oh, my  God. My mother gets through. But that's the way it was in those days. You understand? 

1:17:40 
Why did she do? Why did she get so upset? 

1:17:43 
She didn't like the family that he was marrying into. And I have no idea why Mr. Sennett objected to Joe  Korea or Esther getting married? I don't you don't know Martin sings? It's with my I know, it's my uncle  that my mother didn't like the one satisfyingly because they they've always been these people that  trafficking we don't care yet. The story when you're kind of stuck pins in golf. My mother just didn't go  for that because her brother's gonna marry when I'm Yeah. But it could have been I have no idea the  way the surgeons objected to my godfather me yesterday. But the fact remains, that's the way it was.  And so they had the low and vokalia below. I understand why they wondered myself. Philippi was one  of the he was one of the books just say good time boys. Yeah. He liked his good times. But that's the  way people were taught at that time. They brought it off in Mexico, which was different than Mexico. Or  wouldn't been that way here. 

1:19:28 
So at what age did you leave home? And what age did you leave home? 

1:19:34 
Or 31 Why did you leave because I was gonna get married because I got married. So my mother was I  don't I don't consider that to be possessive but she didn't want to leave home and that's all there was to 

1:19:55 
know so you couldn't leave home until you were getting married boys or girls. 

1:20:01 
Yeah, well it was done in those days. Who in the hell ever heard of a guy? Because he graduated from  high school going out to live in South Bay? I don't remember that happening. It was always when he got  married 

1:20:19 
did your family bring any traditions, any Mexican traditions when they came? Were there any traditions  that you kept up?

1:20:26 
Well I'm talking about some of them right now. The way you conducted yourself towards your parents  and what they expected a view in what you did as per their requirements 

1:20:52 
well, for example, my my father was hell on education. Just even though my older brothers spent most  of her life time finishing med school. He spent the night working in the beet fields in potato fields and  once those harvests were over in the school they went to see and I think that that was handed down to  him because this like he was a bookworm. And I became a bookworm. My daughter is, and there's  three others of my brothers that are bookworms, not I don't say that's the tradition, but it's something  that Shures was having done. I mean, they're one heck of a lot of people in this town. learning lessons.  Don't read a book have never read. 

1:21:50 
Were there any kind of special celebrations or things that you found? 

1:21:56 
No, no, no, I think I think this idea was not the didn't become popular until maybe the Texans came  here. Those ideas Kings, Kings era Yes. And God knows what else they they celebrate. And I've  always been under the impression that it was my own idea that kids were us. We're not here to help my  people all these people that were here before the Texan they all came from my schooling. I never heard  of the thing we're stuck for so some of the Texans and so those kinds of conditions are they should  have come with our parents should have showed up long before the Texans ever got here but never  never shown. So those kinds of things have let's say been acquired by the Mexican people here since  these other people came? And 

1:23:20 
baptism in the Catholic Church Yeah, well I would say so. And first communion parties for that  confirmation. So those are really not to church those kinds of issues 

1:23:54 
become late Yes. That was very much a part of 

1:24:00 
did your mother did you make special foods around? 

1:24:06 
Oh, yes. Oh my mother. It was just a great cook. Her My father 

1:24:19 
never really know what to do in California did I ever find makes him very lucky that people still remember my friends.

1:24:32 
course because of that. When baptisms, even waits. He would be hired to carry make the bread for  those occasions. 

1:24:51 
What kinds of foods that your mother cooked like it during that? 

1:24:58 
Class I remember shrimp 

1:25:01 
employable they're employable. 

1:25:05 
No. It might have been Yeah. Yeah. I know I'm sure because I remember to this day the taste 

1:25:20 
might have been a few days. Oh, yeah. The only thing I remember that lesson Sure. Yes, copy. That's  right there. 

1:25:37 
How I was saying Christmas did she cook any special things for Christmas? 

1:25:42 
Yeah. Well, the most special thing on my list. 

1:25:48 
Did everybody get involved in? 

1:25:53 
Grinders? Grind 

1:25:55 
corner you grounded? 

1:25:58 
Yes. Yes. Yes. Now went on right up to Pearl Harbor. Why did you cry? Well, the milk is attached to the  edge of the table for the clerk. Yeah, yeah, that was tribution 

1:26:28 
I don't remember her. 

1:26:31 
She's like a meat grinder or something like that. But it was a grain grinder.

1:26:37 
Yeah, I guess the one I mean, every Mexican family had 

1:26:45 
started to carry on. 

1:26:49 
So the guys were in charge of meeting 

1:26:54 
the young guys kids. Well, yeah. I remember that day of Pearl Harbor that there was for some reason  they were looking down on this. Or debt. Outside of like, for this family lived and some guys went and I  did. Still doing it that way. You seen Oh, man, I can get that $5 Was it at 

1:27:32 
like a party when you did? Yeah. Yeah. Did that all was involved in the parties. But because the young  people involved that didn't involve drinking, that kind of business. Mostly based on food as a food good.  For example, families here use pork a lot in the morning. So it involves cooking all that stuff  beforehand. And it was yeah, it was I couldn't call it anything else would have party into it. But because  the older people, the older guys were not involved. It didn't. It didn't get into drinking. How did you meet  your wife was over there, buried in that bar where she was a cocktail waitress? She kept many barriers.  We kept ordering beer and so because I have a man because men are that way they eventually start  noticing who's sitting there. See, she's quite good looking at us. So we started going out together.  That's how we became 

1:29:10 
Can you describe your wedding? Did you elope? 

1:29:14 
I don't know if you call it low. But I suppose it was Yeah. And we took cars no mine. My cousin Nick's  daughter her name's Gloria to guide me around this time when we went driving flows to get married and  they weren't married there because the mighty Mexican and then suddenly spoke up and said well, I  was Mexico, part Spanish and so because that they agreed to marry me but as you well know, Spanish  is not my they're not a part of my personal life. To claim, particularly Spanish, most of the Mexican you  know, that's one thing you have to pick up one that probably because of that kind of business became a  dyed in the wool mixture that will not change. Just because they want me to be something else never  had when I was discriminated against just because I was a massive change that sort of hopefully they  won't discriminate that much crap. And I've done I think I've done okay. by many. I've had I've had my  good times too, because I am I like myself because
