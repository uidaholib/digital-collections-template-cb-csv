Nothing's worse than the recent event the mighty laser was during the time of war the patient in the  Philippines in terms of what was happening in the Philippines, and we have some people that call in our  house that was sometimes when they say hello to a judge right away, you say something not in  English. But and. And then my children sometimes get scared. There's somebody down here is calling  you and I can't understand what they're talking about. It sounds like it's under a gallon. And since those  events had happened, and then everything that was shown on the TV was being observed by them.  They there is some kind of an interest because in the school there, the teacheris even started asking  questions about, isn't it your dad is from the Philippines. And then all of those things have happened.  And actually, that was the major reason why we planned the trip this year because of that curiosity from  them. And one of the questions that they asked from me is, how many relatives do we had down there  in the Philippines? I told them it stands up probably around 300. Is that right? Are you kidding me? And  when they wind up in the Philippines, actually, when I started introducing them to my relatives, I usually  say this is your uncle, or this is your lolo or your lola. It reached the point by the time we have been in I  think place they will be the one and B segment it looks a little bit older, another Lola, another Lola,  another uncle, another aunt. But that curiosity, I think what had started in what happened in 1986. 

01:56 
It brought things into focus. 

01:59 
That's right. And people who normally doesn't normally say anything about where his headed heritage  or my daughter's heritage, now begin to be very interested about it. And I think there is a positive side  to it. Because the children also reacted the 

02:24 
Through the process they were educated 

02:26 
they were educated and at the same time they learn something about their own heritage. Many of you? 

02:45 
Well, not under the present conditions, of course. But yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't. I would like to go  back, I feel that there's a lot of things that I can do in the Philippines, one of my pet dreams is to  probably not. There's a lot of things that my children had or were exposed to or benefited from  programs here in America, that I feel would be very useful to the Philippines children. Like we all work in the Philippines, you know, mothers who are working in the Philippines. Where we live our children,  we live them with our maids, our maid or not, they don't have the proper emotional or mental capacities  to encourage or foster many of the educational things that you know the kids can can have access to,  or I know I'm not doing a very good job of explaining it. But like here, when you bring your four year old  or your three year old to a childcare center, because the educational material starts at a very young  age. And so, it's just that there's a lot of opportunities here that I have seen that can benefit the children  of the Philippines and if they are stimulated a certain (unintelligible) at a at an earlier age, rather than  six or seventh grade, which is when they start school. I felt that they can amass a lot more that they can  do a lot more they will be stimulated they can do they can excel in school. One of my pet project is to  go home and build a daycare center and get all of the children of the professors that up the rate to the  daycare center rather than leaving them at home with their maids. 

04:43 
Jake when he was young, they have a home health. The home health department, they have an early  childhood laboratory and the program started to come two and a half 

04:53 
…word was Rihanna is from the neighborhood Brian from , UP. There was never a facility there were I  could bring my children 

05:03 
in demand. Well, yeah. So that's yeah, sophisticated. Yeah. Yeah, Jake started. 

05:14 
I was so amazed at the things that they have here, or available for two years old when I started bringing  my, my son, at three years old to the preschool, but they're called preschool in Pittsburgh, I was just  amazed. I mean, just, I don't think those kinds of services are available in the Philippines. And I,  

05:37 
One of those things that they sent to the Philippines, in one elementary school down there, and what I  did is go and visit the school and look at the books that they sent on that elementary school. And some  of the comments I have heard, especially to the teachers down there is Island, they had some of this  regular visitation by the superintendent, they were amazed at the number of books that they had down  there. Because one of these educational resources that's really buried deep down there is some of  these references, books that the children can use to improve the kind of information that they're trying  to discuss. And it so happened that they sent I think, two sets of encyclopedia down there, including  some of those other technical books. And the reaction I have heard on that one is just a, it's some kind  of a disability because of books, I think, in the Philippines is not as well available, like down here in this country. 

06:41 
as a guide, and I know Pablo doesn't want to talk about it. And that's what he's talking about. Pablo has  sponsored the library in the community where he grew up so he's been sending books is… We've been  collecting books from the area, and then periodically he would bring this drive them to San Francisco, and his family would help pack it and send them Balikbayan. And then those books go to the school  and that's what he's talking about. And I could see that too. Because when I was in school, I mean in  fifth grade, fourth grade, I remember I had problem understanding the world is round, because the  oddities of that we were using were flat maps, you know, and I just couldn't believe it. How could the  wrong, How could the ad be round when all this stuff that I had on the wall was flat? You know,  because we had no globe? I mean, there was just no globe I didn't see a globe until I went to school in  Manila when I was in grade. I mean in grade six so I mean there's a lot of things that we Filipinos here  can do it for the people in the Philippines and we just don't know it but we just a lot of things that we  can do. Janette, I noticed you wanted to go home? Do you consider this is home or the Phillipines your home?  
Iam American but I want to go home… I want to go to the Philippines because I want I feel like I will be  very useful. I because of this made things you know, I just felt like I'm educated, educated in knowing  all these things available that I could possibly… If not me, because I am not trained professionally and I  do not have the educational background. At least I could get somebody interested enough to get there.  But then maybe I've been away from the Philippines so long that maybe these things that I have in  mind are already in existence I don't know. 

08:35 
about the things that you call it or binnorie down here it's some kind of treated in a different kind of  things like the McDonald's down here is it's everybody's fast foods McDonald down there is treated like  as if it's the pizza… I think it's because it's represent the different tools you're in at the same time it  winds up being… 

09:16 
I kind of like the question, question of how does it feel to be a Filipino Boise Idaho or a (unintelligible)? 

09:30 
I have to answer this I think I don't know. I'm the only and the only Filipinos in in in my profession that I  know. And when I go to staffing, I know people if they you know initially they have they would… I don't  think it's making fun but they would call attention to like to some how I would pronounce some words.  And then, you know, I think, I don't know, I, I've never experienced that before. I was an exchange  student before. And, and it wasn't that, you know, not much attention was was given at that time. But  here, it seems to me that maybe people are not used to other culture as much or, you know, like we  were saying before there's that veneer of discrimination maybe to other than, you know, to a culture  other than your own.  

10:27 
Is it not being used to other users, and that used to seeing somebody from another culture occupying a  rather important position?  

10:36
Could be could be, I don't know. It's just that I know, you know, now they accept me for you know, I  mean, they, you know, they won't do it as much as once in a while, yes. But initially it was, you know,  they would say, What did you say, you know, when they know very well, the context of what I'm saying,  but they have to call attention to let you know. 

10:56 
I think it's probably the rural nature of Idaho. Because I think Idaho is more or less probably 90%  (unintelligible) that you can call Idahoans… syndrome or culture that they won't they understand what  you were saying and I knew what he was referring to but they it's just like you talk to somebody you had  a problem on hearing and then it was just, especially with the pronunciation they and the reaction is  different when they are intimidated, intimidated with the person rather than if they don't have any  second way of thinking about you. You can easily differentiate it there is a difference if you move in a  culture where it's dominated 90% by another culture. Sometimes they make joke about some of those  people down there in Pocatello. 

12:14 
Do you notice anything special about your relationship because he is Fillipino? 
No, I think is true just as any other person because we've been friends for two and a half years now  and no difference, really.  

12:36 
You like him because he's Troy. 

12:38 
Yeah. Because different or anything. 

12:44 
They played baseball together 

12:49 
They work together, play ball together and (unintelligible). 

12:58 
Let me ask a futuristic question: Do you foresee within the within Idaho that someday somebody of a  Filipino background whether half Filipino and half American, white American would ever see rise to  prominence say politically or from probably primarily politically foresee that that's possible? 

13:25 
Historically, Idaho is a very liberal state, because they have the firstJewish government. Very well. 

13:41 
benefit of

13:48 
This establishment in Boise from what I have heard this either Basque or Jewish background and I  think was after they get familiar with them, they pretty soon blended within the society of medicine.  Even if you're talking to a guy whose last name is so bizarre, Yetta Morinaga day they kind of blend  within the society. In fact the Secretary of the State is a ….? 

14:23 
Is there political interest among the Filipinos is their national (unintelligible)? 

14:28 
(unintelligible) Filipino American congressman, Congresswoman from Chicago. Her father, was this  time he came here the father came here in 1928. 

14:42 
(unintelligible) 

14:54 
Chamber of Commerce is a Filipino fathers and mothers 

15:01 
So the vertical movement socially is very well possible, politically, very feasible. You may have Matthew  or Brian or Marie… 

15:22 
Marie has got the personality. 

15:25 
I'm sure your mother meant that as a compliment. 

15:32 
(unintelligible) and that is a real class 

15:37 
… explained that handed to them, like 

15:41 
They, they are assured of themselves, they have good stuff, self esteem. And I'm sure that that has a  lot to do also with the support that the family provides them. Because I think that the Filipino family is a  very supportive, very more supportive than, generally speaking, most American families. 

16:04 
I think that are something to that. We, I mean, we the Filipinos that came the last 20 years came 30,  almost 30 years ago. But the the earlier, the earlier Filipinos that came I think, is the equivalent of what  the Mexicans are now. They were the laborers. That was the first wave of migration. And so they did not have as much substance then. But I'd say the last 50 years is, as I said, since I've been here, 30  years, has been the more I guess you'd say educated I've been, you know. And therefore on a different  level of status as the first wave of migration. I had that first the, Enlightenment myself, I came in 60, I  visited an aunt in Stockton, California, and went around the park and all those things and met all the  Filipinos. And they were the ones that I thought I left in the Philippines, you know. And it was their first  generation Filipinos that they had that did not integrate, did not mix very well with it, because they came  from well, I guess you'd say the different social status. And they were mainly in… That's right. That's right. But now, you know, a lot of waves of nurses, doctors, professionals, you know,  so they are exposed to different one. I think that's quite significant, because I don't think it's just the  Asians, you know, the first Irish and the first German that came are the same, the same boat. Evolution of  Oh, I think so. All the ethnic ones came first as the, the dishwashers and all those things.  And then came, they tried to deny their heritage.  

18:10 
Later on. They tried to affirm it. Do you think that although irregardless of the socio economic status of  the Filipino families, you know, granted that the first wave came as a dishwasher or farmworkers, they,  they were supportive,  They also didn't come as families, mostly men, men.  Yeah, but those men labored and send their money home. Right, but their families never came over.  But you know, but the monies were sent on top of children, to better the education of the children. So I  feel strongly that if there is anything in a Filipino family, it's that that's the feeling for I want my children  to do better than I did. 

19:04 
With this thing. It is more or less inbred within the culture to think that way. More or less caring for the  children, I think in a different way. Sometimes some people look at it as being over protective. But I  notice, I think it's just inbred within the Filipino culture by child because some of it, I do it without even  consciously thinking about it. And it so happened that I have a son who always say, why. And I have to  come up with a very good answer that basically satisfied the way how he is exposed right now. 

19:46 
When you help family members, financially, morally, otherwise, 

19:52 
We are being questioned by the end. So I had a lot of gut children. On the Bad Place in Medina, my children notice that I'm giving something  to them. One, one night, this boy, talk to me closely and they say, Dad, can we still go back home? And  I asked him why? Well, I noticed that every time somebody came, that looks like it came very far from  this place, you always give them something. And I explained to him that, well, that's one of the Filipino  culture that we don't do in the United States, more or less, probably because you have grown in a place  where it's very well off. And people tend to think like, more or less, those kinds of things are secondary,  but in the Filipino culture, those kind of things is more or less. I think, inbred. I never didn't even pay  attention to that field of mind. And that not the kind of question I was asked is it's not even related to  what I was doing. And I was surprised and I had really had to come up with a very good answer to that.
