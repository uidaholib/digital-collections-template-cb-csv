00:05 
other lives Asian Americans in Idaho. No. Okay. 

00:14 
And yeah, I think if you could really watch and see where, you know, I stumbled, shall I start Alan?  Okay. 

00:22 
Okay, wearing a microphone so I can hear you and you want to talk 

00:26 
to him. So tell me if this Idaho one of the most is that good enough. 

00:30 
That's another you were talking about before. That's what we've got yet. And I'll go back. 

00:35 
I was a little bit loud earlier. Okay. 

00:45 
Start anytime he says, okay, Idaho, one of the most rugged and beautiful Northwestern states. She's,  it's always at first. Okay, Idaho, one of the most rugged and beautiful north western states. We picture  it's past people by Native Americans and white explorers, settlers and pioneers. Little is ever said about  other races. However, Asians have played an important part in working the mines, constructing the  railroads, cultivating the farms, establishing the businesses, teaching the children and helping to build  this great western state. Although there is occasional mention of Chinese miners, few people realize  that in 1870, during Idaho's Gold Rush, over 1/4 of the people in Idaho were Chinese, and that Boise,  the population center was 1/3 Chinese, though many whites tried to treat the Chinese miners farmers  and business people fairly. The story of the early Chinese in Idaho were laced with suspicion, prejudice  and discrimination. The ones large Chinatown located in Boise is now gone. But the Chinese have had  a continuous presence in Idaho from the time of state. I'll say that again. The ones large Chinatown  located in Boise is now gone. But the Chinese have had a continuous presence in Idaho from the time  of statehood to the present day. The Japanese came to Idaho starting in the 1880s to work on the  railroad, many states to farm and then branched out into other occupations. But we seldom talk about  the fact that in 1943, the eighth largest population center in Idaho was camp Minidoka a Japanese  internment camp in the desert. This is a long one, I have to redo that. But we seldom talk about the fact that in 1943, the eighth largest population center in Idaho was camp Minidoka. A Japanese internment  camp in the desert north of Twin Falls. That's a really hard one for me to do. I went to the eighth largest  population center in Idaho was coming to DOCA. A Japanese internment camp in the desert. North I  guess I should put a comma in the desert is to do north and Twin Falls. Does that sound okay? Okay, take 

03:15 
it from the top with the Japanese. Okay. 

03:17 
The Japanese came to Idaho starting in the 1880s to work on the railroad. Hmm, excuse me. The  Japanese came to Idaho starting in the 1880s to work on the railroad. Many stayed to farm and then  branched out into other occupations. But we seldom talk about the fact that in 1943, the eighth largest  population center in Idaho was completed dhoka a Japanese internment camp in the desert, north of  Twin Falls. 1000s of Japanese Americans were brought there after being forced from their homes on  the West Coast. Living in hastily constructed bare and crowded barracks. They did their best to make  the area livable by cultivating gardens to literally make the desert bloom. The story continues to the  present day as Filipinos and Southeast Asians come to Idaho looking for a better life. Like the earlier  Asians, they tried hard to fit into an unfamiliar, often and friendly environment, while at the same time  remaining true to their heritage and beliefs. These brave and hardworking Asians show us all other  faces of Idaho. Now we go to another part here. Okay, Marie, Marie lelou came to the United States  from China when she was 16 years old. She was the first Asian to graduate from the University of Idaho  in Spokane. Her father was a herb, Dr. Herbert herb Oh, yeah, yeah, that should be her father. I said  here yeah, that's I Okay, spell check doesn't start off. Yeah, my Marie Lilu came to the United States  from China when she was 16 years old. She was the first Asian to graduate from the University of  Idaho. in Spokane, her father was a Chinese ER doctor. In 1926, the family moved to Moscow, Idaho,  where they were the first Chinese family to settle as permanent residents. Her family owned and  operated the grill Cafe, which is now the old Hong Kong restaurant on Main Street. Marie married Milu  and they raised five children. Two of their daughters, Mary Lou and Claire chin we're currently are two  of their daughters, Mary Lou and Claire chin are currently teachers in nearby towns. In the 1920s,  gaining the acceptance of the white community was difficult. And to this day, the loose and chants face  occasional prejudice, but Marie and her family have found that their Chinese values of strong family  unity and hard work have helped them to find a true home in Moscow Idaho. Okay, now SOT people  who see the sewer Naga family shopping at the mall in Pocatello are fishing for trout on Henry's fork  probably do not realize that they are descended from samurais of ancient Japan. Now, Richard sua  Nagas young grandson, Richard the second learns the ancient Japanese martial arts in Pocatello,  Idaho. You have an OB there, okay. Richard's starred in Idaho was a better one. Even though he was a  second generation American, Richard had to face hatred and suspicion during World War Two.  Eventually, his hard work and dependability triumphed. He established suenaga masonry now run by  his son Hugh, who is active in community affairs. His wife Merica sigh. A former dancer who is born and  raised in Idaho, has introduced 1000s of Pocatello children to the art of dance. She has taught dance  classes throughout the country, including Los Angeles, Houston, Las Vegas, San Francisco. Oh, I  mean, we have Houston again. Okay. I don't know. Shall I go with his wife? Okay. His wife Merica sigh.  A former dancer who is born and raised in Idaho has introduced 1000s of Pocatello children to the art of dance. She has taught dance classes throughout the country, including Los Angeles, Houston, Las  Vegas and San Francisco. Good. Paul and scenario Camorra have lived in the Pocatello area all their  lives. Paul is a retired farmer. Having taken over his father struck gardening business. His father was  killed in an accident while helping a neighbor put out a fire Sanaya is a retired Elementary. Sanaya is a  retired elementary school teacher. She is quite proud of her teaching record and pleased that she  received kind words from her former students and their parents. The Oh cameras were founding  members of the Pocatello chapter of the the Oh cameras were founding members of the Pocatello  chapter of the JA CL the Japanese American Citizens League. The Pocatello chapter was established  in 1940 and Paul Okamura was president in 1941. When it received its charter, one of the slogans of  the JCL is better Americans in a greater America. Today the JC 

09:22 
okay 

09:28 
today the JC al No, excuse me today the J ACL has 900 members in Intermountain district. Now. This  is hard one for me today. They today. The J ACL has 900 members in the Intermountain district of Utah  and Idaho and 113 chapters nationwide. 

10:00 
I say ghire seat. say gee Hi ashita was brought to Idaho during World War Two when he was ordered  from his farm in Bellevue, Washington and relocated in the Minidoka internment camp. After the war,  Seiji settled in the Nampa area. He eventually became the first Japanese American bowling center  proprietor in the state of Idaho, and possibly in the United States. His son, who was born in the  internment camp, is the first Asian American teacher in the Nampa school system, and was recently  voted Outstanding Educator. For many years, Seiji did not speak of his experience at the internment  camp. But now he feels it is important that the story be told and remembered. He was one of those  instrumental in the Idaho Centennial project, establishing a memorial and plaque at the side of the  Minidoka camp, and he was present at the groundbreaking ceremony there. For Filipino Americans are  often called the invisible minority. They seldom congregate in special neighborhoods like China towns,  and little Tokyo's, as their Chinese and Japanese counterparts often did. And like the jet unlike the  Chinese and Japanese, early Filipino immigrants came from a territory of the EU, should I should I say  United States or us? Okay. Unlike the Chinese and Japanese, early Filipino immigrants came from a  territory of the United States, and they were brought up saluting and pledging allegiance to the  American flag in grade school. The first Filipinos to come to the United States mainland in the 1920s.  were mainly farm laborers and how servants but Latter Day immigrants are largely college educated,  and are most prominent in service fields, such as medicine, engineering, and administration. 

12:16 
I see that your paragraph down there and when we put back in on your other Oh, okay. 

12:29 
A Boise group of Filipino American families discussed with us the issues and family values,  assimilation, prejudice, and intermarriage facing Filipinos in Idaho. The vagus, you know, so I say that  and then how do we link the vagus just all of a sudden we say I guess it's 

12:49 
part of the discussion. I would don't say discuss with us just see discussed, okay, because we haven't  introduced the fact that we're talking to these people yet. 

12:58 
Right. So we have that with us in here. So I'd take that out and discussed issues. 

13:05 
And then this is this is kind of a conclusion as to what they said. I think the first one, 

13:11 
okay. Okay. And then on the last one we say, okay, a Boise group of Filipino American families  discussed issues of family values, assimilation, prejudice, and intermarriage facing I'm a flat a Boise  group of Filipino American families discussed issues of family values, assimilation, prejudice, and  intermarriage facing Filipinos in Idaho. The Vegas's remasters, bulldozers, and mono buys. Were proud  of their place in American society. They seemed hopeful about the future facing their children. And then  the America is a melting pot or what? And then, 

14:04 
whatever was next after Oh, no, we don't do the clouds. 

14:12 
Are we doing great? Much better? Much worse, the 

14:15 
sense of isolation? 

14:16 
So we were looking for where we should go from here. 

14:20 
How about the sense of isolation about the color but he 

14:23 
has mark that? It's gonna be 

14:28 
Yeah, you're done off camera. Everything else has to be on camera. Did you read this? Yes. Okay, now  we're on camera.

14:36 
Okay. Now let's see how she's 

14:41 
gonna be on camera. So we were scrolling. All we are scrolling you Right. 

14:45 
Good. Thank goodness for Joanne. Okay. So so we this these are bumps Yeah, these are pants Oh  bump, one bump to gate and this is bump. One. Yeah. And how old is this? Yeah, this 

15:01 
you can read also. Okay. 

15:03 
Be one bump, bump. Okay. 

15:08 
All this. Nice. That's Rachel. I was scrolling. 

15:12 
Okay. Bump, bump, bump. And how about this one has to be on camera. Okay. Okay, okay. 

15:26 
Okay, now we're reading the sense of isolation. 

15:29 
No, we're not. I guess. He said that you'll be back on camera for that one. 

15:34 
Oh, he just told me this too. Okay. Well, we'll ask him when it comes back. Okay, we'll just skip that  because I guess you can introduce this anytime. early age, early Asian settlers came to America to  make the fortunes and start new lives. They did not find the streets lined with gold. But they did find the  streets lined with opportunities. After the first generations established themselves, they look to  education to help give their children better lives. Okay. The very wonder if you should do that again.  Okay. 

16:16 
It did not find the streets lined with gold, but they did find the streets lined with opportunities. Okay, so  underline did 

16:23 
okay. Early Asian settlers came to America to make their fortunes and start new lives. They did not find  the streets. They did not. They did not find the streets lined with gold. But they did find the streets lined  with opportunities. After the first generations established themselves, they looked to education is that look or looked? Yeah, so we need an ED there. Okay. After the first generations established  themselves, they looked to education to help give their children better lives. 

17:02 
To help find better lives for their children 

17:05 
with help after the first establish themselves, they look to education to help, that's probably that's fine.  It's just that I couldn't read it smoothly. I'm gonna take that whole one. Okay. Early Asian settlers came  to America to make their fortunes and start new lives. They did not find the streets lined with gold, but  they did find the streets lined with opportunities. Did I give that enough emphasis. 

17:31 
You don't need to emphasize the did not need to emphasize 

17:35 
Okay, early Asian settlers came to America to make their fortunes and start new lives. They did not find  the streets lined with gold, but they did find the streets lined with opportunities. After the first  generations established themselves, they looked to education to help give their children better lives.  The various Asian groups have different views on intermarriage. Although many of the first generation  Asians strongly preferred their children to marry within their respective groups. Life in America has led  to many inter marriages, succeeding generations have had to struggle to reconcile their parents values  with the realities of life in Idaho. All Asian groups have experienced forms of us forms, right, okay. All  Asian groups have experienced forms of discrimination. In early days, there were laws preventing  Asians from becoming citizens and owning land. Prejudice was extreme against the Japanese. Oh,  read. 

18:51 
Okay, since you stopped, I forgot there was something to take out there. I'm sorry. I'm gonna take this. I  don't think it's totally correct. Actually. Government didn't take their land. They just did two weeks to get  out and they were forced to lose their land, but 

19:08 
it's gonna be historically correct. However, this actually taking we're not done yet. Sorry. We're taking  out some more. All Asian groups have experienced forms of discrimination. In early days, there were  laws preventing Asians from becoming citizens and owning land. Prejudice was extreme against the  Japanese Americans during World War Two. An unfortunate example of this was the construction of Camp Minidoka. For 1000s of Japanese Americans were interned. Period. Okay. But something as  time goes on. Asian families have had to compromise between maintaining the traditions of the past  and adjusting to the culture of the present. As time goes on Asian families had to compromise between  maintaining the traditions of the past and adjusting to the culture of the present. Each group, each  family, and each individual must find a comfortable balance between these two forces. Should we  change

20:20 

between these two forces? 
20:22 
Okay. Each group, each family and each individual must find a comfortable balance between these two  forces. Did we read everything? I think so. Okay. No, we'll see how that camera reads. We wanted to  ask him about that. Oh, yeah. Alan, what did you decide? 

20:50 
On the Klauss? Are she on camera for that? 

20:53 
No. Okay. Then we'll read it. Okay. One more? 

21:03 
Where did they go? You have a sense of isolation. 

21:08 
The sense of isolation and the struggle between tradition and assimilation that we have heard about in  the interviews with Chinese and Japanese? Yeah. No one. The sense of isolation and the struggle  between tradition and assimilation that we have heard about in the interviews with Chinese and  Japanese families. were evident also in our visit with a colleague of ours, a Filipino couple who moved  to Boise, Idaho, from California to be near their son. So long run, I wonder how we can break that 

21:41 
to Boise, Idaho from California? Come you want to say a Filipino couple period and then say they moved? 

21:53 
We would probably have because this is all one sentence. How does that sound? Okay. Do you think  it's a long? Okay. The sense of isolation and the struggle between tradition and assimilation that we  have heard about in the interviews with Chinese and Japanese families were evident also in our visit  with a colleague house with a colleague house I think I should bring my Yeah, it's gonna be a period.  Okay. The sense of isolation and struggle between tradition and assimilation that we have heard about  in the interviews with Chinese and Japanese families were evident also in our visit with a colleague  house a Filipino couple. They moved to Boise, Idaho from California to be near their son at the  mountain home Air Force Base. Until their retirement the Kalia house we're active in church ministries.  Okay, yeah, 

22:50 
I need a copy of the script. You don't either because you didn't read it right off. Okay, so I'm gonna run  this forward to this point. Okay. Good, be relaxed and beautiful. 

23:05
Now this is the part that this is the part that I so I hope I don't see. I practice and see and discrimination.  The ones large Chinatown located in Boise is now gone. But the Chinese have had the Japanese scam  to Idaho starting in the 1880s to work on the railroad, many State Farm and then branched out into the  occupations, but we seldom talk about the fact that in 1943, the eighth largest and that squinting oh my 

23:31 
i don't know I'm fixing you here I was working 

23:34 
with 1000s of Japanese Americans from abroad after being forced the West Coast living in hastily  constructed bare and crowded barracks. They did their best to make the area livable. Okay. I'm not  squinting. Okay. Okay. 

23:47 
To be to be smiling and relaxed. We have so much make believe you're you're telling 

23:53 
Yeah, like the earlier Asians they tried hard to fit into an unfamiliar and often unfriendly environment.  Other phases, this program of other phases of their lives is made by people of Chinese, Japanese and  Filipino ancestry, who are members of the Palouse Asian American Association of Northern Idaho. Okay. Where do we start? 

24:15 
So right at the top of the screen, it says this program, okay. Okay, let me go inside. Remember to smile you were reading probably a little bit too fast, but fast is good. Yeah, I was supposed to run slow. 

24:28 
Yeah, I was just trying to test okay. 

24:33 
Oh, yeah. Okay. I'm gonna check your voice level against when you read. 

24:40 
This program of other faces other lives was made by people of Chinese, Japanese and Filipino  ancestry, who are all members to long run. This program about their faces or their lives was made by  people of Chinese, Japanese and Filipino ancestry, who are members of the Palouse Asian American  Association of Northern Idaho. That's a long one. I don't see any way No, no, I just have to remember  this. Catch my breath and 

25:16 
the monitor okay. This program of other faces or their lives was made by people of Chinese, Japanese  and Filipino ancestry who are members of the Palouse Asian American Association of Northern Idaho,  and Eastern Washington. Oh, is there a way we can pause?

25:41 
It is a project. Yeah, 

25:42 
maybe? Yeah, it is a project. Yeah, it is long, okay. 

25:54 
Okay, now Alan has to rewind. Oh, poor Alan. Do you have to go all the way over? Oh, yeah. goes. 

26:06 
You don't have to yell. You got a microphone. I'm sorry. I just have to recycle it. It's it'll be fast. Okay.  Okay. 

26:17 
Good. He needs this exercise. 

26:21 
That's positive reframe. You agree? It's a little bit long. Yeah. 

26:31 
When I write these things, I don't think about people actually seeing it. That's my problem. I'll know  better next time. 

26:37 
I think it's a common thing too. And I tend to do that string alone. I just can't stop I have to put in  everything. And forgetting that that's why we have periods. 

26:51 
I should know because for newspaper writing is supposed to keep sentences short. I do a lot of all  these long sentences in mind. I don't know some of them. Were just 

27:06 
Oh, this one is all yours. You're taking credit for this one. Yeah. This program of other faces other lives  was made by people Chinese. Cheese, Alan is gone. Okay. This program of other faces other lives was  made by people of Chinese, Japanese and Filipino ancestry, who are members of the Palouse Asian  American Association of Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington. It is a project supported by the Idaho  Centennial Commission ethnic heritage committee. They traveled the state to uncover some of the  unwritten and untold stories of what it was like an is like to be Asian American in Idaho. Do the Asians  blend in? Or do they maintain their own culture? How do they raise their children? How are they treated  by the white neighbors? Do they feel at home in Idaho? Are things changing for the better or the worse  for them? How do children feel who are often the only Asians in their classes or school? listen in as to  be raised these questions in interviews and discussions and learn about an often neglected part of the  story of Idaho.

28:30 
Okay, now we go to the conclusion. Oh, that's wonderful. 

28:42 
He's working on 

28:43 
so he has to move it here. Looking at first. America has often been called the melting pot has often  been called the melting pot, where immigrants from all over the world assimilate into the American into  the American society into American society. Either one, okay, whatever feels good, okay. into American  into the American society into this into society. Maybe we'll remove it the into American society. 

29:12 
Yeah, it's gonna take a minute, we're just 

29:17 
going to practice Yeah, into American society. From all over the world assimilate into American society,  losing their losing their original cultural ties. America has often been called the melting pot, where  immigrants from all over the world assimilate into American society, losing their original cultural ties.  Our interviews with the Asian Americans of Idaho, fit better with a more recently proposed metaphor of  a tossed salad where each element retains permit 

29:51 
so you're not on screen for this, but go ahead. Oh, no, no, because we're going to show the people eating. 

29:57 
Oh, there you go. How wonderful. Did you actually know that maybe this is the one he meant. Yeah,  yeah. Yeah, maybe we should tell him he's he's listening to us. Okay. Yeah, I think he has we're each  element retains its own distinct flavor, but all combined into a single delicious experience. Certainly  Idaho has been richer because of the contributions and hard work of its Asian Americans. Obtaining  acceptance and recognition has not been easy for them. But in spite of the struggles of starting life over  in a strange land and the pain of the prejudice they have had to face the people we spoke with place a  high value on the beauty and advantages of the state in which they live. In all our interviews, we heard  the constant theme that we want but that we heard the constant theme probably you'll say something  different there though. That Idaho is my home Let me pardon me 

30:57 
I'm just wondering about the court where was showing let me ask you. 

32:03 
We're going to read it all and then he'll cut some heart. Oh, some parts of cut to the people eating but 

32:09
we'll put it all on camera for now. Okay, for now, that's the decision. 

32:13 
Yeah. So so he's still going? Yeah, it will probably be 

32:30 
well, have a pause after cultural ties Okay, that'll probably be where they switched to the other one. 

32:36 
Give it a long enough pause. Okay. 

32:42 
I think this is going to say something else because it doesn't look like he's changed the the thing even  though that's why I sent it to 

32:49 
all forms No, we're not there yet. 

33:03 
Are introduced with it and just bear with a more recently proposed metaphor of a tossed salad. 

33:11 
Here we go. Okay. 

33:16 
And you say Pause, 

33:18 
pause it. Just a slight pause after cultural ties. Okay. Smile. 

33:28 
America has often been called the melting pot, where immigrants can I start over again, Alan. Joy  SUTA hits headphones. America has often been called the melting pot for immigrants from all over the  world. assimilate into the internet. I'll read for now a little bit. America has often been called the melting pot, where immigrants from all over the world assimilate into American society, losing their original  cultural ties or interviews. Okay, in our interviews, we pause. 

34:00 
I hear I can hear you. 

34:03 
Yeah. Okay. 

34:11
America has often been called the melting pot, where immigrants from all over the world assimilate into  American society, losing their original cultural ties. Our interviews with Asian Americans of Idaho fit  better with a more recently proposed metaphor of a tossed salad, where each element retains its own  distinct flavor, but all combined into a single delicious experience. Certainly Idaho has become richer  because of the contributions and hard work of the Asian Americans. Obtaining acceptance and  recognition has not been easy for Okay, stop. Okay. Too fast. 

35:00 
Oh, okay, does she need to start from the start from the top or just this last? Okay. She said he says  you're leaning a little bit to the left get set yourself up straight. 

35:12 
Okay. Better. Okay. 

35:14 
So 

35:16 
certainly, certainly certainly. Certainly Idaho has 

35:24 
certainly Idaho Okay. 

35:27 
Certainly Idaho has become richer because of the contributions and hard work of the Asian Americans  obtaining acceptance and recognition has not been easy for them. But in spite of the struggles of  starting life over in a strange land and the pain of the prejudice they have had to face the people we  spoke with place a high value on the beauty and advantages of the state in which they live. One  constant theme heard in all our interviews was that Idaho is my home that's good. We probably  shouldn't it's 

36:06 
always my hormones 

36:06 
yeah 

36:11 
we do that one one more time because that always went home yellow was okay, 

36:15 
we're gonna be shooting memorize that. recycles. 

36:21
Okay which one? Which one? Okay, memorize which one 

36:27 
last paragraph? I don't think so. Whereas when I'm recycling Yeah, you had a perfect up until the very  last the constant theme that Idaho is my home. You know what I'm trying to say? Right, right up to that  point. It 

36:49 
was perfect. Actually what it is is it seems like in my mind, I'm done but in spite of 

37:06 
I'll take forever. There's no rapid rapid Yeah, that's no fast forward that fast forward like some Well, 

37:16 
there's one more paragraph and it's gonna be real good. 

37:19 
Okay, I think they hope so. Be a wrap as we say in the business be a wrap. 

37:24 
Yeah. When it when something's right and printed. They say it's a wrap. I don't know where I learned  that. 

37:31 
It's a wrap up. It's done. Now we're gonna wrap it up. Yeah, so how's the 

37:40 
certainly Idaho is certainly Idaho has been richer because of the contributions and hard work of its  Asian Americans. Obtaining acceptance and recognition has not been easy for them. But in spite of the  struggles of starting life over in a strange land, and the pain of the prejudice they've had to face, the  people we spoke with place a high value on the beauty and advantages of the state in which they live.  In all our interviews, we heard the constant thing that Idaho is my home 

38:10 
that Idaho is my home. It's not quantified it's really I think it's it strikes a good it's a good statement of  people who say they are you know, they're having some difficulties but on the whole this is their home.  Yeah, and they've accepted that and they're saying accept us positively and just as we have accepted  you positively I'm think the message is very, very, very good. Yeah, it's 

38:38 
good. And it is true. They all did say that. Yeah, 

38:41 
that's what Murray said we heard the constant theme that Idaho is my home

38:51 
they were partly filming that today. 

38:53 
The garments are it's because gardens 

38:58 
what are these? They're not garnets. I think this looks like amethyst, Amethyst. 

39:04 
And Jade. 

39:05 
Fears now I can steal the Jade you can steal the others. This is very interesting. Well, maybe maybe  those are those are empathic to our garnets are a lot darker. 

39:25 
Must be guarded here though. 

39:27 
I can remember Kathy Rui when she and her mother were in Turkey to visit Alan, I guess. Pick up Alan  and Annie. They go to this bizarre bazaars. And she bought a whole year like you see in the movies.  Kind of like a cloth sack filled with gems. Oh yeah. And she says they don't know whether it was glass  or what have you. They didn't care. This bizarre owner you know, open the strings to the fluffs person,  kind of stuff. Woon the contents on the table and she says would sets a flare and they said we'll take it.  We don't care what it is, do they ever have it appraised, turned out to be value? Oh, I think there were  some valuable ones. But there were some kind of just like that, you know, can you imagine having  somebody spilled out on the table and say, well, it's yours for $10 you know? It is fun. Yes, that's a very  lovely green. 

40:29 
I think this is going to have this international is pretty. Got a number on. Yes. 

40:44 
Wonder what that is? Oh, it reminds me of some petrified wood. I wonder if that's what it is. It's lovely. 

40:54 
You're going to have an International Bazaar on campus tomorrow. 

40:58 
And Saturday. Do you know what kind of a bizarre? 

41:02
You see stuff from a lot of different countries? I always go for that. Whatever. So where would it be? I'm  on the ad lOn. Well, that 

41:13 
would be nice. Yeah. That's that's part of the international something. Celebration. Yeah. Did you get to  attend president's inserts? 

41:23 
I did go. Yeah. It's nice. Yeah, 

41:26 
it's something positive. Yes. Big extravaganza? Well, I 

41:31 
mean, I don't know what would have cost a whole lot about if I didn't stick with our freshmen. But other  than that, it's Yeah, I guess there's always a big cost now in in in setting up the Kibbie dome 

41:44 
for anything. Oh, they had you mean they had to pay for the Kibbie dome? Well, they 

41:48 
don't pay for the kid at home, but they have to, I don't know 

41:51 
hire people last year, 

41:54 
but it wasn't really an expensive extravaganza at all. 

41:57 
Well, paper played up to $30,000 but that's really not that big. 

42:02 
Spent that on on bringing the guest speakers probably 

42:06 
probably. How about the refreshments that's provided for by the university, but they 

42:11 
probably had to pay for that.

42:12 
But what's not very much

42:14 
I didn't stay but I saw somebody bring back you know, his cake and supplement didn't look like a big  deal. It was late. 

42:23 
Oh, here okay. 

42:28 
Okay, before before, let me let me read again. Certainly Idaho has moved richer because of the  contributions certainly Idaho has been richer because the contributions and hard work of its Asian  Americans obtaining acceptance and recognition has not been easy for them has not been easy for  them good. Yeah. has not been easy for them but in spite of the struggles of starting life over in a  strange land life over but in spite of the struggles of starting life over in a strange land and the pain of  prejudice, they have had to face Facebook alone. Okay, certainly had a host become richer because of  the contributions and hard work of Asian Americans. Obtaining acceptance has not been easy from  emphasize not but in spite. Okay. 

43:15 
And remember starting over is one story starting over as one verb you know, it's not starting over don't pause. 

43:24 
Oh, yeah. Starting over. Starting over starting over. 

43:29 
Is she writing on me? She read my camera okay. She could hear me you hear me? 

43:46 
Yes 

43:53 
my phone off. Oh, okay. How's that? Okay. Issues issue centered rent. Control, issue centered right. 

44:11 
Thank you. Okay. Okay. 

44:29 
Certainly Idaho has become richer because of the contributions and hard work of the Asian Americans.  Obtaining acceptance and recognition has not been easy for them. But in spite of the struggles of  starting life over in a strange land, and the pain of the prejudice they have had to face the people we  spoke with place a high value on the beauty and advantages of the state in which they live. One  constant theme heard in all our interviews was that Idaho is my home If I lost it again, then 

45:03
I'll do it. Okay 

45:10 
Oh well we do we switch right to Well, no, we go to all those other people anyway. Say now the whole  is my home. Yeah. 

45:24 
Okay 

45:29 
yeah 

45:32 
I missed that last line again, Joanne, I can't do it again. He wants to do it again. 

45:39 
He's reminding him to make sure it's okay. 

45:45 
And you have to do them in a row or six Monday nights, but you're going to do six sessions to come up  with a two year or three year goal for your group. You tell me how we can structure those sessions,  what we can do in them to make them very creative. Lots of fun, exciting. And so people's minds get to  open up to some of the dreaming I was suggesting in the first half. What would we do call it out? Good  settings who said it? Great with like, where might we not meet in the office? Don't meet me Office  meeting good settings. Like where might we need homes, outside retreat centers away from the office  and away from phones. What else might we do to make them fun? We might use brainstorming real  legitimate brainstorming where everything goes, you just splash it up there. You don't get to turn and  say we did that it didn't work. We tried that it failed. It's a horrible idea for Spokane. That wouldn't work.  You mean all that negative stuff we throw on people? Do you know what I mean? Up Joanna. And then  we get completely negative and mean. What we want to do is allow the brainstorming to take off and it  goes wild real good brainstorming what else do we do? feed people feed people well feed people often.  Eat early eat late as Mayor Daley used to say vote early vote often. Eat early eat or feed people feed  them well start with a song so people are doing something creative from the start singing enjoying  themselves. What else will we do? Visualization, visualization, do some kind of imaging or vision in  imaging visualization that gets people out of the humdrum day to day thinking about the work what else  might we do Michael? Absolutely get the key players there. So somebody later doesn't say that's a  great plan. But I wasn't involved deciding that we would abandon other programs and only focus on that  and then suddenly they are suddenly deflating everybody's enthusiasm. I wasn't there. Get the right  people involved. What else do we do? What else we I have heard groups do light and lively is what I  call lighten Lively's, fun things sharing things. We'll do some light Lively's this weekend, I have to tell  you that I've heard groups do very funny things. I've heard groups use a lot of silence, where people  thought and wrote on their own without saying it for a while. So they could formulate a whole thought  without somebody else either squashing it or adding to it or anything and people have used music,  background music tapes, whatever, you know, some of these techniques, use them to make it exciting. 
So it is not the dry, awful, very left brain brain process that people fear it will be lack of spontaneity  groups feel that doing long range planning will kill the spontaneity of the whole organization, will it?  Okay, why won't it somebody some of you said no, why won't it? How are we going to counter that  argument? Why doesn't it kill the spontaneity of the organization? Our duty? Thank you. You don't have  
to long range plan absolutely every aspect of your group. Absolutely. You can pick one goal. Well, how  else does it not Sonia. George Leakey who is one of the organizers and founders of movement for new  society, and Philadelphia says, making a long range plan. I love his phrase. He says it allows you to  harness the energy of intentionality. You know how when you know you're going to do something, you  can suddenly rise to doing it. With Sarah Pirtle can announce that she's going to write a children's book,  she can suddenly find the time make it a priority. It's harnessing the energy of intentionality I will blank.  And I think energy rises. What else can we do about spontaneity in our group? I use an example earlier  in the earlier half. I said there are people who will love to respond to crises happening in the world,  there will always be those people in the group, what can they form? The Rapid Response Network  Exactly. Every group will have some people who do love the day to day crisis and the responding and  the reacting. They just do and you know, God bless them. We need them to because they can form a  rapid response network. I know a group that has a rapid response network and darn it if those people  don't truly stay up till midnight writing a press release and getting four letters and getting other people in  the group to just sign them because they'll type them up and running down and putting them in the  night slot. I've done that I've gone through our local paper and put it in the night slot. So it's there in the  morning. There are people who love to do that, given them that job. There are people who can pull off a  vigil and 24 hours, there's only eight of them out there, but they're out there with the banner in there,  then give them that to do that's fine. You can we can find a place for everybody. So when you said to  squash the spontaneity in our group, I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I think we're about overvaluing  that I think we're overvaluing that we get to be spontaneous. What is it? What's it a code word for?  When you hear we'll lose our spontaneity? What is it somewhat of a code word for I like this group  maintaining its ability to constantly React, React. And I think that gets old fast. We can stay reactive  forever. We can have a vision and go on. Jan, are we into things that are reducing resistance, and I  want another one? Why people resist this to come to a consensus about a goal. And I wonder if that  would be difficult. Yeah, consensus building can be hard. In fact, I am going to help you build  consensus consensus building around a goal. In fact, I'm going to help you with a process that does  that. In fact, people fear that the group actually coming together on something is going to be harder  than it is often people feel relief, that the group is actually focusing on something. And I'm going to  show you a process that builds consensus over six weeks. So we will tackle that one in our six steps.  So let's get it up there because it's right. People fear it. And it's why they will tell you they don't want to  do it. Why else resistance consent continues? Why else do people say they think this is a good idea,  but it's a good idea for another group? They don't want to do it Joanna position? Absolutely. Absolutely  said again, their positioning? Absolutely. What it does is it threatens leaders. It threatens leaders, and it  does. Why do I mean, why do I put it up there like that? How does it threaten leaders? They are not  sure they want the group to go through this at all, because it may limit their power, which it should,  people are going to be able to take pieces of the plan and carry it out delegate work, see where they're  going measure the success involve more people, it actually might attract more volunteers. And in fact,  leaders can be threatened. And they won't say that straight out. They will say other things that won't  straight out, say I think it's going to limit my power. I think it's a bad idea who's gonna say that? No, I  mean, you know, but what might they say? What might their other lines be? Over time, we don't have
the time. That's a wonderful one. When a leader sits there and says long range plan, we don't have the  time to make it, we have to take it slow. We got we have to we don't have the money, we don't have the  time. All of that is see through that cloud, it may be saying you know, I've got a feeling we're about to  share some power, or equalize some some decision making around here. And I don't think I like it at all.  Be ready to deal with that. Because what Joe said is absolutely true. It threatens the authority or the  power of certain leaders, it can call people on their founders disease, you go back to the original vision  often and it's huge, but the leaders hold on to it like you're violating it. Now, that will be the  smokescreen, and let's put up with Carol said, let's put that one right up here. People will tell you that  they cannot engage in the process because they simply have no time. Oh, engage in six sessions. It's  gonna take six evenings to make a long range plan. Some groups have the luxury to do that. But are  certainly doesn't. We were in, you know, people will tell you straight out that they would rather hold on  to their little events that are planned for the next few months, ad infinitum, than to take the time and  maybe even lay down a program or not do an event to take the six sessions to plan a direction for two  years. It's just playing false economy. It's sort of a crazy answer. We don't have the time to be well  organized. We'd rather be less effective than our community, we'd rather be wedded to our events.  Exactly, exactly. We don't have the time to know where we're going in three years, we'd rather limp  along, we'll say how can we possibly project three years in the future? Well, the alternative alternative  is, we just work with the data we have week by week and keep responding to it. They did this horror, we  respond. They did that horror we object. That's data addiction, because it's all coming down from  Washington and the right wing and we stay reactive and negative. We have enough data to know  where we're going and to believe in it. But you are not alone. I mean, people will say that. The response  I think is we know in this group where we want to be let's stop hooking our plans on to the catastrophes  in Washington. We're fine now what's wrong with the way we are? We're fine now. Don't fix it. If it's not  broken and there you are standing in front of the group trying to convince them that it's broken. That's a  very hard place for you. We're fine now why can't we keep functioning as we are some wouldn't  respond to that being said in the group. What does that do to us running a long range or suggesting a  long range planning process? We're fine. Everything's been just fine for four years. Andrea, it puts you  very much on the defensive. And what's a way out of that comment? Anybody can think of one. Okay,  bye. 

55:19 
Okay, bye. Okay, bye. You're just continue along your merry road and say, you know, that's not what  I've been hearing. In fact, meetings of getting been getting smaller events were running or attracting  fewer people money seems to be an issue and folks that I've been told you're feeling some despair  about the group, give them back the facts about their group, say it to them. And if you fear this, talk to  people about the group before you go in. So you can say, you know that my experience isn't that it's  been actually quite different, which is that events are not as successful as they have been that people  are groping for a future. And people are wanting a sense of knowing where we're going. So my  experience isn't that, in fact, we're fine at all, Bill, 

55:59 
another long range planning thing I was involved with, it was suggested that you identify people who  tend to be blockers, yes, at a time, ganging up on him.

56:08 
That's nice. That's a nice concept gang right up on them for the meeting. You can you can talk to them  individually, that people who will in fact object and you can absolutely count on it. Yeah, you can wire  the meeting, you can get people there who you know will agree with it. And you can also talk to  blockers individually. So the lifecycle of the organization, my experiences, friends, we've consolidated,  but we're also dipping down and hear the Simpsons. So you'll hear this, and I for one, don't buy it. I  don't know very many groups still doing the short term events who are fine now. I just I see the  symptoms of the fatigue and the despair. Any other ones? Exam? That's common. What do you mean  long range planning? What they will tell you straight out is they're unskilled they don't know how to do it.  What do you respond? You learn to process Thank you very much. Here's how he says very simply,  here's how, at that point, you say funny you should ask. Happy to go to this workshop. And I have six  steps up my sleeve. So one, two, absolutely. You say here's how the people will tell you that we we  don't know how to do this when you mean long range planning to your goal. They feel inadequate.  Speak to it. Speak to let me tell you some of the ones that Haha, what number am I up to? 12 with  somebody take notes for Joanna. to I think I'm up to 10. Thank you very much. What big fear at this  point in the workshop came up in Albuquerque? Why were those people having a real hard time in their  groups making long range plans? Nature nature? And I tell you, I think it does permeate our  movements. It was real clear in the workshop in North in New Mexico. But those folks did not want to  set long range plans. And they admitted to it in the workshop because there was some fear of  succeeding. What am I talking about? What is fear of success in a movement that says it wants to win  and make change and has a vision of a different kind of world? What is our fear of success company?  Misery loves company what else? People actually are now worried about their jobs. We have a lot of  people who have jobs and peace centers in peace and just end there. That is a truthful statement.  When you talk to people they will say that winning may mean that they are out of jobs and they have  wedded their life to this work. What else is our fear of success? Responsibility? Absolutely, it comes  with new responsibility and new accountability. And also what I heard in New Mexico, and what I've  heard before, is that some people believe that if we start succeeding, we're going to start looking like  the enemy. That if we lay long range plans and get more organized and lose our spontaneity, and  actually know where we're going, we're gonna look like GE, IBM, and the Pentagon. Exactly. And I  don't buy it just like I don't believe money corrupts, or power corrupts, or long range plans corrupt. I  believe, for every minute that we can hold on to our integrity and know where we're going. We don't  have to look like GE because we have a two year plan. We don't have to look like the Pentagon  because we're promoting something for once. But I do think it is a fear in the movement and in New  Mexico. They were articulate about it. I mean, when no one went to six, seven or eight, wouldn't you be  worried? Really, and this came up loud and clear and it wasn't number 10 They just said we don't want  to make long range plans because we're not sure we want to win 

59:53 
have a lot of a lot of fear around that we are movement devoted and wedded to Adhocracy we'd love it.  Do you make an ad hoc you excuse it, that didn't work because we had too little time to plan it. That  wasn't a success, because we just we didn't have enough time to pull that one off. People love to  excuse complete failures, because we just didn't have enough time to do it. You make a long range  plan and you see how you're doing. You can measure it. You can call a group, you can call Little Rock,  or you could because it's done and say, Have you raised the money for the water purification? Say,
Have you bought any part of it? Is any engineer willing to go down there to yes or no? They've got real  answers. Do you have any vets in the school? That's their project, and Youngstown? Do you have  anybody going into the schools, where we expect it to have trained 15 By now we've only trained nine,  but we've trained nine, they can actually tell you how they're doing. We love to excuse our failures.  Because we didn't have enough time that one didn't work, we really had to pull that off quickly. That one  was marginal, but we're hanging in there. We love it. Ha cracy I think this is a real fear in our  movement. Let me share with you, I seem to quote the great guru in the sky. Major General period  Smith all the time, I really do love him. I devoted to this man. And I want to tell you that what astounded  me who I know made sure to interfere. I'm you know, his hidden admirer, Major General Perry ham  Smith has a wonderful article here. Let me just read you the second paragraph. Because it's a little bit  out of context here. But it's actually a good paragraph, and it will help us frame the rest of today. And  then I'm going to tell you what he was when he lists this the resistance in the Air Force to deal with long  range planning. It's great. But this is his second opening paragraph, I read it for quoting him. Long  Range Planning will never solve all the problems. But it does create a mindset in top leaders that  causes them to ask the right questions when they make tough day to day decisions. The most  important thing for a decision maker to ask and in respect to long range planning and thinking is the  following question. How does the decision I am about to make fit into my vision of the future? My long  range plan and my long range priorities? And you know, it's a good question. It's a good question. So  Sarah Pirtle, somebody has my book. So yes, Sarah Pirtle could say if I intend to write every day, and I  have a son, and I have a job, and I am on several boards, how does this decision I'm making today to  do other work affect the fact that in five years, I'm expecting to have a book out and published and I'm  not going to have any time to write today, tomorrow or next week. Did you get that question? How does  the decision I'm about to make fit into my vision of the future?
