00:44 
Why don't you tell us about your family? 

00:48 
See, I am the eldest of five, family of five. And I was born up in black. And oh, let's see. family migrated  down to Thai here, which is about six miles north of here. And her went to school there. Most of my life,  I mean, first through the sixth grade, and then I came into Pocatello to go to high school. After that,  mom decided that I need to be a more refined labor like so they sent me to Japan, I was in Japan for a  year and a half, came back. And I went to Utah State for a year. And then was married, had my family  and after my, the youngest boy was in the fifth grade, I went back to school, plugged along and, and  tried to get my degrees I went along. In the meantime, I got a job in this foxhole school system, and I  taught for 21 years and primary grades. enjoyed that experience very much down and then fall in love. I  have been married now for 22 years, I think. And so we have the combination of two families. 

02:42 
I, let's see, other than just working for all those years, I suppose that I'm having been in Japan. My life  has been a happy life. But I can't say that there was anything particularly exciting or you know that you  think of that now I think of all the things that a person can do now, I think it would be wonderful. But in  those days why? We're pretty much set, especially the girls like you can be a teacher or a nurse, men  being of Japanese descent why? Jobs were hard to find. And in fact, most of the girls around here just  
didn't think that it was possible for us to get jobs. But I was fortunate because I knew the the  superintendent of our schools because I had worked in BTA and he had promised me I said well when  you get ready to detail. So I hadn't quite finished with my degree. But I started there was a year of  where there was a shortage of teachers and I just started and I continued on and finished teaching  getting my degree. My DJ 

04:14
Do you know why your parents came from Japan? 

04:18 
My father was a very adventurous guy. He had gone to Washington University in Tokyo for several  years and decided that he wanted to try coming to America and sewing came on over any was one of  those wonders that hit stoned the freight cars in those days, you know, wandered all over the United  States doing odd jobs. I can tell when he 

04:49 
came here to the United States. 

04:52 
What year I have the information on the sheet there but I can tell you up and down He must have come  right around my team. A nine along there, I think like he talked about going through Colorado, picking  cucumbers going to different parts, you know, parts of the state and picking watermelons and things  like that. And then with travel. A lot of times, I guess he was just a regular old trap, he said during the  attack on the freight cars and moving from parts of the country to another part. But when he was 37  years old, why his mother decided that he should get married and so at an our family was that my  father's mother was an adoptive mother, Dad had lost his mother when he was about three or four and  was adopted into the dmrb family. And she had a sister. And so these two my grandmother's of mine,  were actually sisters. And so when the dad Manabi, mother decided that, that needs to get married, and  she went to their sister and said was you've got a daughter? And I think she'd be a good wife for my  son. So would you mind talking to her and seeing if she would come to the United States? So  grandmother approached mom and asked her mom, mom was the only daughter, she had two  brothers. And she said, I don't want to go that far since is that halfway around the world. But after she  thought about it, she decided, well, if that's what you'd like me to do, I've been she would come. So  she, at the time she was teaching school in Japan to give at a game. 

07:13 
Did you feel that you were raised in a traditional Japanese family? 

07:17 
Oh, I think mom tried to awfully high, but I just wasn't very much of a good performer, I guess. Because  they just felt like when I graduated from high school, I needed to be sent to Japan. Take Well, I think  after many, many years, I'm just beginning to appreciate it. You know, as a person gets older than you,  you begin to see, well, I see why mom wanted me to become more of a lady and the different things  that they taught me when I went back has come into practical value, you know, and I've been able to  pass it on to my girls and tell them well, you know, I can see like, grandma sent me back because the  different things that you need to learn to do. And like, when I went back, I didn't understand the  language. So for six months, you know, it was just hardly any communication at all. And I move they  sent me back with a family who the husband, Mr. Suzuki had come to the United States as a an  exchange student. And during the summer time, I don't know how my father became acquainted with  them. But during the summertime, he used to come up from Logan and work on the farm for expenses  spending money during the year and after he had been with us for two three summers why then he promised my dad mom that if anyone in our family ever needed to go back to Japan, they would be  glad to do the same for us, you know, to take care of. So I was sent back all my the lady that I had to  live with the wife of Mr. Suzuki. Her father had been was a prison warden in Shizuoka City and a very  strictly motivated person you know, and everything was on go but you had to do it according to the  strictest sense of Daphne's manner at that time and and me going back as a 1718 year old you know,  just as carefree and and I'm concerned about everything especially responsibility a man I mean, I must  have been horrible. But anyway, they sent me back so you can imagine what the change was, you  know, but I had to go through one of the the jars like I had had to do was every night after school I they  had an old boy was about a year and a half. And it was my job to pat him on my back and walk until I  put him to sleep. I was rain or shine that was the same routine that I had to go through every night. And  if it rained, or it was stormy, then I'd have to walk a mile with the Japanese apparel Japanese get us to  meet the master Mr. Suzuki, who was commuting by train through another city because he also was a  teacher. And I'd have to meet him. But to get on him so that he could walk home, you know, not that his  feet wet. And then there were, there's another chore I had to do. And of course, that was every night, I  would be the last plan out. And they had what they call a GET UP mic or you put all your gifts out. And  so you would place all the guitars in the in the boxes and neat little rows. And then in the morning  before that everyone would get up and go to work. Why then I'd have to get up and take the get those  out and put them out on my veranda so that you know what they came down, they'd be able to get into  it. And I know towards the end, I resented it. Because I think, well, why need to do that when every  night and I was the last one there. No one went out after you know the they went to bed. And so  naturally the ghettos would be in a nice, neat row, the next morning, when they got up there, I couldn't  see the need for putting him in the boxes every night. But that was just one of the routine and discipline  discipline, things I think that I had to learn to do. And school every day was good, because you know,  they go to school, they're, what 11 months of the year, they went to school on Saturdays. And then on  Sundays, I had the flower arrangement from 11 in the morning until about four or five in the afternoon.  My days were busy. And at the time, I didn't really appreciate all the things that I had to learn to do that  I think as years gone by least it's taught me to be more patient understanding and that type of thing that  I probably wouldn't have learned. 

12:42 
Regarding you growing up in this area, how have you noticed the community interact? You're  changing? 

12:50 
I haven't really it seems as though I've I've grown up kind of what do you call it? Just very happy,  atmospheric thing. You know, we all have our ups and downs. But I think basically speaking, I haven't  all the years that I taught school, I never met but much discrimination. I'd find low children coming up to  me and, and not realizing that I was Japanese, you know, in our conversation because I have one little  girl that came on. As we were visiting. We were studying about Mexico and Latin. And she was  wondering what color to color the skin complexion of her picture. They had to color and I said, Well, I  think perhaps their bodies as dark as I am. And I put my arm out and she came up and she was just a  little blonde, just as light complexion. And you know, she's just always just about like you and me that  and you can see. And I noticed that for the first time she hadn't realized there was any color difference,  you know, between us. I had many wonderful experiences like that one time when at school, and we had some third graders who I'd had well, we were in a team situation on top the last proper 13 years.  And so we had the children for three years. And by the time you have been that long, you know, they  get to know you very well and you get to know them. And we have our annual Christmas festival type of  parties that we had every year. So we were to dress in our native costume and go to school and our  recess time. One more girl was talking to the teacher whom I was teaching with and said, You know, I  think Mrs oakmark AR makes the best Japanese I've ever seen. And it had, she hadn't dawned on me  being anything but just like herself until I wore the Kimora on, of course, but just made it separate, you  know, differently. I meant, she said. But she just makes the best Japanese. So when she came in, my  other teacher said, you know, Debbie didn't even realize that you were Japanese. She She didn't  realize it until today. And I had to point it out during myself. Oh, well, that's me. Well, I've had  experiences like that, that have really been rewarding. 

15:38 
How about your parents and their parents? Yes, 

15:41 
they were very supportive. I think I can only possibly just one out of all the years that I taught one  parent and, and so when I found out that I, this parent was, was questioning, you know, me being a  Japanese and that I asked the parent if she would come to school, and we and I could visit with them.  And I was going to tell them that if, you know, they opposed to having their child as my main, the third  teacher why then we can easily enough have a child transferred to another teacher, because there  were several teachers who taught the same grades and other bills and by the building that we went in.  So did another bother you? Have people not recognize I? 

16:39 
Don't I don't think in a Santa, it ever bothered me. I've always known that I was Japanese. I it's just one  thing that I've always been proud of. And if there had been, you know, serious problems, or something I  might have worried or been concerned. But basically, I know Paul and I were just talking about the  other night when I said, you know, I, I had never had to face a problem that was off my serious. So I  said to him, Well, have you had to when you're thinking about it? And they said, No, not really. And so I  think we have lived in a community where they have accepted us and of course, we've been here all  our lives. And maybe that makes a difference. There haven't there aren't as many Japanese as there  were when we were younger. The families have either moved to California or they've passed on and  that type of thing. And of course, as a younger generation grill has gone to school, they have all gone to  school out of state and to different universities you know, just haven't come back Dido because we just  don't have the businesses here. One thing 

18:09 
I noticed is that you have Japanese art all over your house. And I was wondering how much cultural  influence you have instilled into your children 

18:24 
I think I should have probably Sibley instilled more than I have. Because when I've visited with my  girlfriends and different friends they have done they've asked me Well, have you taught your children Japanese like you you know? Like your grandma so they can communicate with your grandparents and  I've said now that one thing and I know the year that my mother died she had said well I'm going to  teach start teaching the kids some Japanese so we can they can understand some of the things that I  you know, tell them in Japanese but then we missed out on that opportunity to speak Japanese Oh,  because I've been to Japan possibly the only reason why you know am I just speak birth mother well in  their fight peewee said ladies around and I used to speak well enough to read magazines and  newspapers. But I couldn't I couldn't retain it and try to master my English too. So one had to go and it  was Japanese. 

19:39 
Paul, how would you how much did you raise your children within a Japanese culture? Was it more  American? 

19:48 
There's one thing about this Japanese culture that comes for most my mind is that they have a sense  devolved delegation and responsibility. And I've tried to impress that on my children, not to forget when  someone does you a favor, or helps you in any way. But outside of that I don't, I've told them 

20:26 
my three daughters I have separated from my mother and my mother. And one of my sisters more or  less raised those girls for me. I was there at home with them. But being girls couldn't couldn't do too  much about it, except being the fact that I was your father. So I've told my daughter's houses. Don't  ever forget what your grandmother had to go through for you. 

21:05 
But they had their Caucasian friends and I didn't try to influence their childhood too much. As far as  culture went, and there they can understand my mother fairly well. When she talks to them, but they  can not express themselves to my mother. 

21:46 
Except in English, my mother uses mostly Japanese and talking to them. They get a message somehow
