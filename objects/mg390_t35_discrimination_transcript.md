Introduce. But Marie and her family have found that their Chinese values of strong family unity and hard  work have helped them to find a true home in Moscow, Idaho. 

00:19 
How come that we went into the restaurant business was the, my father and mother came around. He  said, Well, let's go around the police country see what they, my father and mother came around, he  said, Well, let's go around the pollute countries, you have a sly, like, you know, so they came over here. 

01:12 
Ever since I've been here ever since 1920. But I could not become a US citizen until 1943. Paul Buck  was one of the persons that got this law change in the US government. And so as soon as we were  able to join, my husband and I a went to get our citizenship paper at that time. And if you're not a  citizen, of course, you cannot buy land or building or anything like that. And so at that time, you have to  Buyten your children's name, because they are citizens, and they are allowed to buy, and we cannot  even vote all these years, until after we become citizens, 

02:01 
I had to do a little bit better in order to succeed. She that's been that way throughout my life. If I want to  hold down a job, no matter what, I had to put out a little bit more effort to be a little bit better than  anything I do. So came my little depression, some that hold on to me and get rid of the others. But if I  were equal, I would have been the first one to let off. That is, racially because if you're competing with a  bunch of Caucasians, you're, you're just mud unless you excel in your ability a little bit better. 

02:37 
I stopped it was a noon hour. So I thought I'd stop and my wife and my son was about a year and a half  years old, 

02:48 
stopped at a restaurant there and didn't get waited on. And finally the waitress came over and said, Are  you Japanese nicer to Japanese descent? Yes. Well, we don't serve yourself. I think she was more  embarrassed than I was. But we left. 

03:06 
Well, one day when there was a junk in there, he saw us eating. He got on the table, start preaching, he  says we got to get rid of them. We got to kill them, causing us a lot of trouble that was rush, who had nothing just a fork and knife. And the guy was with he was managing our team. And I told him, I said,  you know, the book can be attacked, not by one person, but the whole mob here. 

03:34 
When they call me names, having to do with my race, it takes me more personal than if they tell me that  I'm ugly. Because you are aware. I think it takes me it. It bothers me more because they're insulting my  whole race. They're insulting. My whole background. And what I believe in, 

03:55 
didn't French was the dean woman at that time, you know, she had a good talk with my sisters as well.  You mustn't go out with American boys too much, you know, I mean, but of course, my sister didn't go  oh overboard, but she has her regular friends. So well. If the other students can keep can keep the  boyfriend so I can I you know, go out on dates with them. 

04:30 
I've always felt like I've been because I'm Oriental. Because I'm Chinese. And I've always felt that all  the way through school. If if, if in the classroom, they would recognize they would know me first before  they knew all their other little faces in the room. They would know my name first they would know you  know their expectations of me that they would know me for so I always considered a special. I always  thought that I'm so special that everybody's gonna notice me. So to me, it's never been a negative  discrimination. It's always been fun. positive and, you know, and this is my experience with it, and  therefore, when kids call me names, it's just the fact that they're noticing that there's something special  about me. 

05:07 
When I go to staffing I know people if they, you know, I initially they have, they would, I don't think it's  making fun, but they would call attention to like, to some how I would pronounce some words. And I,  you know, I think, I don't know, I, I've never experienced that before we I was an exchange student  before and, and wasn't that, you know, not much attention was was given at that time. But here, it  seems to me that maybe people are not used to other culture as much or, you know, like we were  saying before, there's that veneer of discrimination maybe to other than, you know, to a culture other  than your own 

05:51 
record, see that he share a heading or San Pedro or San Francisco, we headed east and I knew we  were going to Mexico I didn't have been I knew how to navigate to like me, I had to skip his license to  home and house unsuitable. And by doing that, it took us about 15 days to get back from Hawaii. But  we finally ended up in San Pedro see our home port was was in San Francisco. Well, we got in Okay,  then, you know, who's waiting for me? Guess who? The FBI know about a dozen that come up and  they grabbed me and says now don't you get away? You're gonna get off this ship. We don't trust you.  But did you know that all the Caucasians deserted us? One day I knew for years while the propaganda  was that the Japanese were treacherous, you cannot trust them. They all bleed that say 

06:52
I'm proud to be a Japanese American now. I wasn't. I was always proud of that. But it meant a lot of  trouble during the war years. But having weathered the storm and went through all the troubles and  getting through it, you know in good shape. I always say that I'm proud to be a Japanese American.  This is roughly around two weeks, when a definite word came that we had to leave we weren't going to be able to stay the summer. We had talked about it ever since December 7. But it was middle of May  when I left and we had to just about two weeks notice to get everything in to get all your business in  order. Dispose of anything. I sold a refrigerator for $5. So thick up nine to 36 model Ford pickup for $50.  And a man who was I considered a good friend traded with me at a service station where I figured it  was a good friend. He said I will send you the other 25 When you let me know when you get there your  address, which I did. I never did see him again. So I got $25 for a 1936 pickup. Camp life I spent two  winters severe cold that we weren't used to coming from Seattle area and real hot summers that we  weren't used to the lack of privacy and that was one of the worst. Of course the cramped quarters.  When I went back into camp I had my mother and two sisters and my wife and I baby in the 20 by 20  foot room. So you can imagine no running water just bear light bulbs hanging down from the ceiling. No  partitions no toilets was a community toilet. I guess by the time I went there it was a little better used to  be they didn't have toilets. It was outdoor without water. Those that went and opened up the camp and  then a dhoka had the worst of it. That was dusty when they got there in August. July and August. Dustin  ankle deep. Then in September October the rain snow came and it just got mud. You leave your shoes  in the mud. You know what I mean? It slip off 

09:49 
but it was a hellhole How did you feel about it? Well, I felt that I didn't think it was right. Really, because  it was 

10:08 
they were supposed to be citizens and to be put into a place like that, you know, I guess, more or less  thought that they were entitled more than that if they had to be put under some kind of security. So I  didn't think it was at all fair. 

10:29 
I gotten over the disappointment I had, and went through hardships are went through on account of  evacuation. But there are people that need to know and people that would understand if they got the  story. But if they just read propaganda, and listened to it, and never been told, they would carry that on,  they'd be teaching that to their children and continuously grow. This experience that we went through  should never happen to any group of people. 

11:02 
I think this monument is long overdue. The Japanese American Citizens League supported it with  money. We support it as an educational tool. We support it as a reminder to all Americans of America's  rather sordid past 

11:17 
you yet you don't realize that any of you don't realize what happened to us.

11:23 
I know that a lot of people at my school do like me, but they always know that I'm there for them when they need me. 

11:37 
Do they know that you're half Japanese? No. 

11:41 
I don't care. Well, no. To any of the 

11:45 
kids that you play with, give you trouble because you have Japanese. 

11:51 
No, but there's one kid you gave when I was at my little girl school. 

11:57 
But that wasn't because you were Japanese. Just because you're 

12:04 
three years old. 

12:07 
If there is any discrimination right now, it's probably more than a positive one and a negative. I think  those that are still continuing to discriminate are probably a little bit ignorant of the facts. You know,  when I say a positive discrimination, I think, I think because of because of my father, and people like  
him and our grandfathers, they earned the right they earned that respect, I think from from this  community and the country in general. And so if anything, it's it's more a matter of pride now to be  Japanese, because so much more is expected of you. But it's it's a wonderful challenge that I think that  we're as a race, I think we're up to 30 children during the day being discriminated against, no, I again, I  feel that they're looked up to be they adapt, and they accept all of the different races very, very well. In  fact, you know, one of the things that I'm happy to say is that when someone else for example, a black  is discriminated, my children can understand that and they usually side with that poor, unfortunate child. 

13:20 
As long as the country realizes that we need immigrants to help us in our industries, our labor supply, I  don't think it will happen. But when that happens, though, then we probably have some people in  Washington who don't realize the significance of keeping our industries moving or keeping our society  far develop or far more developed than other countries like Japan or Europe. 

13:51 
They look beyond what color you are, what race you are, they look for the person they definitely do. So  I mean, sure. You'd have some people you know look at the outside

14:05 
I think is true just as any other person because we've been friends for two and a half years now. No  difference. 

14:34 
Seven of them 

14:36 
into that so when you say they can you clarify that who would not allow 

14:42 
the law belong in Colombia in California? Maybe maybe in the United States. I didn't know how I didn't  know this. But in California, they didn't. It was not allowed for for intermarry. intermarriages, so he can  marry them. 

14:59 
So Reverend Carla knew would take them to Reno. Yes. 

15:09 
Well, how did you feel about the intermarriage show? What do you think of intermarriage? 

15:18 
I went so far, like I have been talking to him that in my observation here, all those there are many that  we know who are as good as when they are Filipinos are there are many combs it's themselves see  that there are many that I know that we deal with, that they have the best husbands, they have the has  the they're the best husbands in the American side.

15:53 
The races have been able to mix them and be a cohesive group. You know, I always thought that  when, when I was younger, I had a friend who was Caucasian, and I, it was a very dear friend, because  we live he just lived down the street aways and, and if something came up, and he proposed to me, I  still, as much as I thought of him, I wouldn't have thought of marrying him because at the time,  Caucasians were, you know, and Japanese married just just didn't go. And they had all these laws to  that, that regulated us from so since that time, it's really been almost a complete turnover. And because  we have children in his side of the family and, and mine too, who are married to Caucasians, and doing  very nicely and I think I think just as much of the daughter and Miles's if you know if they were  Japanese and I think the grandchildren naturally their district grandkids are just extra special. And like  you say we've got blonde and darn near blonde, blue eyes and curly hair, you know, I said I'm, I've  often wondered how mother would think if she saw curly haired granddaughter or grandchild, because  in all in Japanese always had a straight black hair. And here we have our grandchildren who are pretty  curly brown hair and beautiful all his complexion and everything. And somehow I feel like that the  offsprings have an inner marriage, the children seem to be stronger. And healthier, better, and stature.  They're taller. They're better looking. They're much more intelligent in school. I mean, all the children,  you know, I've done very well on school. So far, so they always talk about hybrids, you know, the first strain of a hybrid being so good, whether it's wheat or corn or whatever. I kind of think that with  children, too. 

18:15 
We, each of us, when we graduated from high school, went to Hawaii for a summer. Yeah, of course,  we had been raised, you know, amongst, you know, in Moscow, in essentially an all Caucasian  community atmosphere. And so when I went to Hawaii was the first time I had been immersed into, you  know, a multicultural setting. And I realized when I came back, that my dad was right, and that I would  marry within my, you know, with, at least within the Orientals. And so then Leonard and I started,  Leonard already had was working on his master's. And so we started dating when I was a freshman in  college. I was married at the beginning my sophomore year. And I really feel and you can ask my own  children, this because they've also gone through this, but I still feel quite strongly, 

19:04 
you would say you're raising your family, you and Leonard, in according to the traditional, traditional  Chinese 

19:12 
way, well, from the standpoint of who they marry, okay, and who they want to make lifetime  commitments to as far as a family. How do you feel about that? 

19:23 
I don't know. I never. 

19:26 
I just kind of think about more of getting through college and finding my own career before I even think  of having somebody else to marry.

19:37 
They have a lot of priorities as to what what kind of guys that we date, they would want us to marry a  Chinese and in our race, I agree. In I see their standpoint, but it's, it's it's a modern world and you have  to, you're living in a white world. out. So I think of myself as both Chinese and American and white and  stuff Lutece 

20:09 
parents were, I'm sure a bit apprehensive, more for her sake, I think than mine. They were concerned  that she wouldn't finish school that she had been a valedictorian and all of these things in school and  they had great aspirations for her. She had great aspirations, and they thought when she married  somebody, somebody from College, where she gonna go? I think it's worked out, right. 

20:42 
I think it's also, you know, parents never tell you really what, you know, how they feel. I mean, it's part  of the culture they infer, right? I mean, it's all in for, and I think my mom has inferred to me that when  she grows old, you know, I won't be there as a girl, you know, usually the woman takes care of your ancient parents and, and he was quite, she was quite apprehensive about that, that I won't be around,  of course, because they might, you know, fall on my husband. So when she was 

21:09 
born. So how is it now? 

21:13 
She comes every two years sometimes with my mom or with just a mom, I mean, with my dad, and she  comes into visit and I tell her, you know, when she needs me, I'll be ready. Around my kids do so. 

21:30 
My mother would have been worried if I married somebody else. Just you know, be sure you know what  you're doing. Be sure it works. Knows, 

21:40 
afraid of divorce. Everybody in America gets divorced. 

21:44 
At the time, the time we were going to get married. Another one from Los monos. My hometown. I was  in the process of getting divorced with his American wife, who happens to be a good family friend. So  that was something that my mother as well. Are you aware of this? Are you aware of that? I? Of course  that Yes. But like any ideal is it's ever happened to me. 

22:18 
All Asian groups have experienced forms of discrimination. In early days, there were laws preventing  Asians from becoming citizens and owning land. Prejudice was extreme against the Japanese  Americans during World War Two. An unfortunate example of this was the construction of Camp Minidoka for 1000s of Japanese Americans were interned. 

22:45 
I'm proud to be a Japanese American now. I wasn't I was always proud of that, but
