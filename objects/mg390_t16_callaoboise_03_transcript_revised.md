While you both look very nice and very young, very fit for your ages really?

00:12 
Yeah, when he's when he is he's one. There are this this year in, in March, May, and two of them in  May, 19 years old and one in marks right here. So three of them 3 90 year old. And that is the Oh, there  they are just once. 

00:41 
Okay, let's let's go back to the way you raised your children and your grandchildren, we would like to  know how you raised them? Or do you raise them in the Filipino way? And what do you mean by that?  As far as discipline, respect for the elders? And can you talk about that a little bit? 

01:02 
Yes. Well said it might be children, the children nowadays they call they call you by the name, first  name, first name or something like that. Or, but I teach this grandchildren to say we are their  grandparents. And they had to say grandparents to us forever. We want them Apple or Lolo or grandma  or but really they mostly are talking only in English. That is my that is my, my, my mistake because I am  not. I have not taught them our dialect, see with others, they they insist them to learn, Mexican,  Chinese and Japanese, they teach them their dialect talk to them in during their infant days, you know,  but me I never did to my children or their grandchildren. Back. i There was a comment at one time that  somebody read a an article that was written by my son in a magazine. And this this friend told me, he  has shame on you. They said you you have not even taught your child to speak your dialect. Yeah, so I,  I was teaching this girl here. She is inquisitive. She likes to see like to whatever, I say some things that  are how do you say that? So I'll tell it but you know, they don't say it right? You know, and that's the  reason I don't really try to force them to learn because they, when they pronounce it, they pronounce it  awkward. And that's why I don't want to do it. But I tell them how to respect and I help them, I help  when they said we may help them in their lessons. And I have to admit there are no lessons and I teach  them all the manners and the way manners of the Filipinos, I teach them. And then what they do to their  parents, how do they act to their parents, I teached all those to the kids because I really praise them  from but my other son I didn't press them. Because when she had my my daughter in reference, you  had debate children. She laid off from school from teaching. So (unintelligible), they're about four or five  years old. 

03:37 
How about education? How important is that to you? 

03:42 
I really helped them I had to tell them to do all the work the studies I helped them to. Because I told  them that if they do good, they they will that, is their that that is theirs, not others. So they have to learn  so that at least they can have scholarship to to assist them in their expenses, if your parents are poor. 

04:17 
So they're doing good.  
And you find that they're…? 

04:21 
I have I have my oldest granddaughter is held that several scholarship as we did last year that she  decided to go to Boston. And that's where she is now in Boston 

04:34 
On a college scholarship? 
Yes.  
Very wonderful? 

04:40 
So I don't know about deciders but I check on them. I had to check on the record status I they post me  on they then I check from my daughter also you help them do you help them especially when they went  far away. Are you helping them? 

05:02 
Oh, yes.  
That's very good. 

05:04 
I have to check on them. 

05:07 
There was another thing I wanted to ask you: Do you do anything with the senior citizen groups in the  area?  
Well, not 
Both you and Reverend Callao? 

05:20 
No, we just go and attend sometimes. Where there is a senior citizens here, we just go there. And 

05:28 
How do you find out of their activities? 

05:32 
They have so many different hours. They sent us a bulletin. See, we received the bulletin every month  or every week, every month, I think we receive… We receive bulletins and we know all the news about  it, then. They were they said, they asked if we needed help or something like that. And could they  contact us. You know? So matter of fact, they said, if ou need help. They would send some babysitter  for him. So I could go out, you know, because I can't leave him in the house. I can, I have to bring him  every day, I bring him to the mall just for a walk for exercise, you know. And they offer all those but I  said at the present time, I really don't need it. But I will surely need your help now that says and they're  really that's, 

06:31 
That's good. Very good. I'm curious. You and Reverend Callao, if you would have any words of advice  or wisdom to give to the younger generation generations, what would you want to say? 

06:47 
Now if I'd be but what are we going to say? But really say but will you advise 

06:54 
advise the young people young Asians, Filipinos, Chinese or Japanese? What would you what would  you like them to do? What would you like to tell them?  

07:04 
Well, so probably to get good, good education. And to do well, to do good and what can I say? 

07:16 
Sounds very good. 

07:19 
What can I say? Because there are many many of our youngers here it get mixed up with all these  other things right. They will be off see. So if they had an advice from some older people, probably it  would be okay. 

07:38 
Thank you. Thank you very much
