have access to this kind of information if there's a group of coaches from the Philippines who will be  coming over to visit goodwill to… 

00:14 
No, I know a lot of Chinese and Japanese not either 

00:21 
There was really nice group that was hosted 

00:24 
with capacity to 

00:28 
be over there. It's got it. So nobody's there. Pretty close. 

00:36 
This way, we can get the flavor of what's the various Filipinos and their spouses in the area of Boise  and Idaho. Doing gives a profile occupation mechanic. 

00:53 
Okay, shall we start with ? 

00:59 
My name is Ruben (...). And by profession, I am a civil engineer working with the Idaho transportation  department. Formerly the highway department. 

01:12 
don't talk to the camera talk to… 

01:19 
Go, this way or you're straight with? 

01:22 
Talk more about what you do?

01:24 
In my profession?  

01:26 
In your community? 

01:29 
With the Idaho transportation department, I worked with the, the planning and programming sections  that deals with programming most of the infrastructures activity in the state of Idaho. They deal with the,  how to budget and prioritize the projects that's going to be presented to the community. 

01:52 
How long ago did you come to Boise? 

01:55 
Oh, I think that's around 1972 or something like that. I have two children. one boy and one girl. My boy  sitting on my right side, his name is Troy and this premises with him. 

02:18 
I'm Ludi (...). I'm an occupational therapist. I work at the Idaho Elks rehab hospital in the pediatric  department. As a clinician I deal with kids with disabilities from ages zero to 21 years old. I come in  contact with a lot of parents and other professionals. I do consultation with other schools and other  government agencies dealing with kids and you know with the problems 

02:46 
Why did you come to Boise? 

02:48 
I came to Boise because my husband was born and raised in Caldwell. So he is an Idaho boy. 

03:01 
And that's Marie of course over there. My name is Ted Vermont's. I'm Ludi’s husband. And I grew up  here in Caldwell. So this is coming home to me. I met my wife when I was studying at UP in the  Philippines. And we spent our first five years of married life there. Our son was born in the Philippines. I  came back here, got a job with Morrison Knutson, which is a construction engineering firm. I work in  their personnel department and affirmative action employee relations, career planning for the  corporation. We have one of the… Yes. 

03:52 
What did your parents think of both sets of parents think of the marriage the intercultural marriage? 

03:59
I think the strongest feeling I got from my parents was, it's about time. I was, I was 27 or something at  that point. But they, they felt that I was ready for that. And, of course, it's difficult to think of yourself  married when you're single, but in retrospect, I think I was too. Ludi’s parents were, I'm sure a bit  apprehensive, more for her sake, I think than mine. They were concerned that she wouldn't finish  school,that she had been a valedictorian and all of these things in school and they had great  aspirations for her. She had great aspirations and they thought when she married somebody,  somebody from where she gonna go, I think it's worked out all right. 
Do you agree with that? 

05:05 
I think it's also, you know, parents never tell you really what, you know how they feel. I mean, it's part of  the culture they infer right? I mean, it's all in for. And I think my mom has inferred to me that when she  grows old, you know, I won't be there as a girl, you know, usually the woman takes care of your aging  parents and, and he was quite, she was quite apprehensive about that, but I won't be around. Of  course, because then I you know, I follow my husband and so what she was worried about. 

05:32 
So how is it now? 

05:35 
She comes every two years sometimes with my mom or with just a mom I mean with my dad and she  comes into visit and I tell her you know when she needs me, I'll be ready. And she likes being around  my kids do some of his work…? 

05:58 
Go ahead. This is my son Jake. He's 12 

06:04 
Can you tell us a little about about yourself a little bit? Your school your school activities and what you  …? 
I go to East junior high and. 

06:14 
I play tennis, they're competitive. 

06:19 
Are you a good tennis player?  
I’m, okay. 

06:25 
Do you, do you notice anything different about your family? Because it's an intercultural marriage?

06:33 
Not really.. 
Do your friends notice? 

06:40 
Not that I know of, right now. 

06:44 
Thank you. 
Few months 

06:52 
Have you ever had friends who, or playmates who said anything about you because you are different  because you were darker had black hair, whatever? 

07:08 
No, no, no so far.  
How do you think of yourself?  
What do you mean?  
Good response. 
When people ask you? Are you American? Filipino?  
Usually people don't ask me that.  
Good question; good response.. What do you want to be when you grow up? 
I haven’t figured that part out yet.  
Yeah. It's good. 

07:41 
I'm Raulio Vega. I came to the States as a graduate student in 1960. Currently, I’m an administrator  with the Department of Agriculture in my work I deal with the legislature, or with the farming community,  the Commission's in the states, they mentioned when commission alfalfa growers. I'm involved in  certifying Idaho products to be exported to different countries. 

08:22 
You talk to your sister…

08:26 
I, as an activity I play a lot of tennis, volleyball, tennis. I coach I've been coaching little league baseball  for the last five years. Currently coaching soccer team. There's a lot of our wish I could do more  gardening, cans or vegetables and fruits with my wife. That allowed fishing and hunting hiking… and  spend as much the last as much time as we could with the kids. We got four sons. 

09:08 
I haven't had the opportunity to mix with most of the Filipinos out here because summer is occupied by  sports. Winter I usually play and boy (unintelligible) rather the club so I don't get as good a chance to  make  
So do you feel a sense of community with Filipinos in Boise, Idaho?  
Oh, I'm always a Filipino. I have to admit I haven't had any social interaction with any for the last five  years anyway. 

09:45 
When did you come to Idaho? 

09:47 
In 1960 

09:49 
When did you and your wife get married? 

09:58 
I got we were married. In 1964, in Moscow, Idaho and as I work in Idaho for oh, what good 14 years  now. 

10:16 
And which one is your wife? 

10:17 
My wife Sharon is in the back. I guess.  
She's sitting… 
keep an eye on 

10:33 
I'm looking at a monitor  

10:43
(unintelligible) three steps 

10:53 
this is my son, Brian. Come on.  
Well, I go to school at Capitol, play sports.  
Loves hunting, 

11:12 
Hunting, camping, fishing, and I said sports. 

11:18 
Brian, you notice anything different or unusual about your family? As opposed to noninterracial family? 

11:28 
No one ever says anything all that seriously about it? I mean, I get teased at school, but just by my  good friends. No one else says anything. 

11:37 
It's just kind of a friendly type of teasing.  
Yeah.  
You're comfortable with it doesn't matter to me.  
How about you Matthew? 

11:54 
That changed by that tell them your name first. 

12:01 
I’m Matthew Vega. I go to school at Hillside Junior High seventh grade. Pretty much the same as Brian.  I like sports hunting, camping, fishing. 

12:15 
What are some of the things that you think are very important to you?  
How do you mean? 
I could be more specific? What do you value? The question is, let me ask you, how do you feel about  your mom sitting behind your dad? See, that's the proper place for your mom? 

12:50
Well, that shows the driver in the family. 

12:55 
So who in your family? How does? Let me ask because Sharon, how many of you raise your children?  What… 

13:10 
There is… A good way of asking. Would you raise your children? In terms of your because you have 

13:16 
like  
Do we have any problems? Because we came from different backgrounds?  
Yeah. What kind of guidance? Do you follow in terms of how it should be? 

13:27 
Have you… trying to reconcile the two cultures in your upbringing? 

13:32 
Well, originally, we thought we would try to make them more aware that they were Filipino heritage also  and, and he thought that they could learn the language. But that didn't happen. And as far as… they  grew up in their first several years overseas, not in the Philippines or in the United States. And I think  they didn't feel particularly that they were either one. You know, when we came to the States, they said,  Oh, we're going to be all different. You know? Yeah, yes, she did. And they thought that they would feel  strange, but it didn't last very long. And as far as at home I don't think there are any that much  difference between the two cultures. I mean, between our two ideas of how kids should be raised  anyway. A lot of people tell us that they act mature for their age compared to other two American kids. 

14:29 
And do you know what they mean by that? 

14:32 
Yeah, I guess I do now and I know when we came back to, my older kids said American kids are very  babyish. Just, just immature compared to their age. I can think of it well just like taking responsibility for  doing their own homework or, or for making sure that they're, that they're going to have something to  wear in the morning you know, or like telling me If, hey I need I need this sweatshirt washed, you know,  instead of waiting till the last minute and then having an emergency,. Things like that are doing what  they're asked to at home without complaining. We've never had any problem with that. And from what I  see in the cartoons and hear and seeing the advice columns in the paper, I guess a lot of people do. I  have no idea whether that's because of culture or just because we got neat kids. 

15:33
Was it was a problem between both sets of parents when you decided to get married 

15:41 
because of this intercultural relationship? 

15:45 
Do you want to answer that? 

15:46 
My parents, of course, in a way was very glad, because if I got married in the Philippines, or my family  being the boy would be spending for the wedding. No joking aside, that was the first comment when I  told my mother, so at least I don't have to pay for you. Nothing more than, my mother would have been  worried if I married somebody else, just you know, be sure you know what you're doing. Be sure it  works. No specific 

16:20 
They were afraid of divorce. Because they had the idea that everybody in America gets divorced. 

16:24 
At the time, the time we were going to get married. Another one from Los monos. My hometown, he  was in the process of getting divorced with his American wife, who happens to be a good family friend.  So that was something that my mother, as well. Are you aware of this? Are you aware of that? I? Of  course, said yes. But like any ideal is it's ever happened to me. 

16:53 
Well, we were noticing as we were interviewing people that Filipinos seem to be involved in more  intercultural marriages than some of the Asian groups in, in Idaho. Would you have any ideas as to why  that is? 

17:11 
I cannot address that since, myself when I came, I came as a graduate student, did not… Had no idea I  was gonna get married here. I'm in never planned the, you know, I came as a graduate student. At that  time, I thought, through my my graduate studies, I'll be back to my job, I resigned my job, and I came  but I say I really could not relate to Well, I'm not denying that priority. Some, yes, I'll come to America  and get married and stay. But that was not in my mind when I came. So I cannot address that one.  
It just happened? 
I guess that's 

17:55 
Maybe because we are more open, I think, to other culture, I mean, since we've been colonized for  many years, and we're used to, you know, other cultures than our own. And therefore, we've got that  awareness, and

18:07 
Speak English to which meet somebody and get on close terms with them than say, somebody from  China. Most Chinese who don't speak English. Well, even if they can read their fluent and reading well,  

18:21 
Even, even black women, you know, I mean, your your black women here, they're not as open to  marrying a white male. I mean, what a black male are more prone to marrying white women. And I think  it's also I don't know, I don't know. I mean, I just look at that they speak English. So and also, I don't  know, I think there's, that's a difficult different cultural phenomena, maybe, but I think it's that  awareness of the acceptance to that there, you know, the presence of another culture than your own,  whether that's positive or negative, I don't know. But it's, you know, it's there 

18:56 
Is either family or any of the families here planning on passing on the Philippine culture to this to their  children in some formal way? 

19:08 
Very often speak to them about the Philippine traditions, how family relationships are not with the idea  that Hey, you gotta follow this, essentially, you know, this is how I was brought up. This is how things  would have been in the Philippines or at least in my specific community. Again, as I said, not  specifically Hey, you gotta follow this because this is the Filipino way more more sharing my experience  with them. Be up to them to make use of that the lesson or phase of life, as it would be adapted to their,  to their society now or the place where they leave 

20:00 
David is very interested in older kids is, is quite interested in being aware of, I guess you'd say the  Asian part of his heritage. He's also the one that looks most filled. Well, maybe not Filipino, but he  doesn't. He's less He's the least white or at least American looking into the others I think could be  mistaken for just being Caucasian. He feels different and he feels treated different.
