I didn't go back to Bellevue because I had nothing to go back to really. I went back to see I was leasing  my land. My neighbors all already owned theirs prior to the war, that I had leased it in live there quite a  while my dad didn't. He was going to buy it, but it got down to within about $500 Now that's going back  1928. That $500 separated whether he was going to buy that farm or lease and we kept leasing it, year  
to year lease. So when I went back everything that I had left, farm equipment, furniture, household  belongings, you know, because we was only allowed to carry a suitcase a piece. There was somebody  living in the house, not the person that I left it in charge of. He showed me a government bill of sale for  everything. So I couldn't… there was an irrigation system on a little farm too and stuff. So I go back and  had to start from scratch. There was nothing there. So I stayed out in Idaho. Right so I happen to be  one of the few that was from Bellevue. In fact, I'm the only one from Bellevue that's still in Idaho. All the  others back went back home 

01:35 
Well, why don't you tell us a little bit about how you got to where you live, you know? 

01:42 
Should I start at the very beginning at the time I was evacuated or go back or 

01:46 
whatever horses brought to 

01:49 
When war started, I was evacuated to camp Pinedale in central California. After a short two months,  stay at this assembly center. I was transferred to the to Tule Lake relocation center.  
Where did you start off from? 
Bellevue Washington and start out at Bellevue Washington. Then at Tule Lake I spent from July through till April 1 of 1940 43 April 43. And I left as soon as I was allowed to leave the camp on a  temporary work permit. And there was a representative of a sugar factory located in Nampa, Idaho that  were looking for workers to work in the beet fields in Caldwell and Nampa, Idaho. Therefore I signed up  for that and left Tule Lake with a group of 14 some of them I knew. I was the only one that was married  at the time. So we went out to work there work the summer there. And then the fall I went back to a  camp that was camp Minidoka. 

03:18
Because free wine, so let's leave it because we might might use a picture later but okay, save  everything you can with government. So in the spring, 

03:30 
okay, did everything (unintelligible) 

03:31 
get through and it says (unintelligible) 

03:37 
LT one. (unintelligible) 
When the evacuation order came, I was living in Bellevue, Washington. And the whole community was  moved to camp Pinedale in California. And the mid middle of May 1942. We spent two months there  and then we were transferred to a more permanent relocation center which was Tule Lake relocation  center. And I spent the winter there from August through April and left the camp as soon as I was  allowed. It was only a temporary work permit but I moved out to Ontario, Oregon and worked for a  farmer there doing various farm work in the beet fields, onion, picking potatoes. And then in the fall in  November, I joined my mother and two younger sisters who had been transferred from Tule Lake to  camp Minidoka. I joined them and spent the winner there. And in January of 1943, my son was born in  Minidoka relocation center and I left on a permanent work permit to Caldwell, Idaho. I went to work on a  farm there for four years. And then I started farming on my own, sharecropping. Saved a little money so  I could pay down on a farm… I bought a small farm and bought a little farm equipment and started  farming on my own in 1951. 

05:34 
And then, July of 55, I was approached by a man that owned a bowling center in the town of Nampa.

05:48 
And he said, Why don't you buy a bowling center, I want to… I got one for sale. You only have to buy  half because I've got somebody that wants to buy the other half. Well half made a little easier to handle.  And since I was spending so much time bowling anyway, I was farming but I spent a lot of time. So I  thought it over. He only gave me one day to think it over one night. He said you think about it and talk it  over with your wife. And because there's two three others that want, which you're in line, the person  about the first half wanted me as a partner. So my wife and I talked to her we decided to give up the  farming and try bowling business. I was probably one of the very, well I know I was the first in the state  of Idaho. One of the first in the whole country. I think there's one or two others that was in the bowling  as a bowling proprietor. 1955 in the country. 
Japanese  
Yes. Japanese American Yes. And I stayed in that business for, until 1982. Spring of 82. I sold out my  interest and retired. Then after a year of retirement, I got tired. And I'm now at the present time working  in a bowling center. That brings us up to the present time as far as time spent.

07:23 
Are you aware or do you know the forces that brought your parents over to America? 

07:29 
Yes, I think most of them that came over, our parents that came over, were looking for a better life. I  think like most Issei parents, they came with a dream of making and saving money quick and going  back to Japan. I think that was their intent. From what I have gathered talking to older people, most of  whom are gone. My dad died at the age of 60. So I was 21 at the time. But he told me that that's what  he planned to do. But in the meantime money didn't grow on trees like they thought it was going to be,  so he was then he started a family. So you know it was the gave up idea of going back. I think that's  probably the way most of the families that settled here. Some of those that came later to the country  before immigration was stopped. Some were educated people. And they started businesses when they  came here. But the very first ones that come over we started working on farms started working on  railroad started working in coal mines, mining. My dad came by way of Hawaii and he spent a year in  Hawaii. I'm not sure what year he came but my my mother came in to Seattle in 1917 in December of 1917. My dad never did go back, get a chance to go back to Japan. My mother did go  back in 1940 Just before the war. And in fact, while she was there they were because she didn't go  back to November of 19… for the 1940 and in the spring she came back in December, February of  1941. And even then, they were saying that there was about the last passenger ship to come back from  Japan to Seattle. 

09:33 
How many brothers and sisters do you have? 

09:36 
two brothers and two sisters 

09:38 
and where do you go? 

09:40 
I'm in the middle of two older brothers and two younger sisters. What are they out? 
They’re in Japan? The older brothers the younger ones. The two younger sisters are both retired and  they live in Caldwell which is a short distance from Nampa.  
They work? 
Yes, my sister, the older sister's husband was a farmer, native of Idaho Falls. 

10:09 
And after they got married, he came to Nampa to farm. And my younger sister married to someone I  knew when I was in my teens back in Seattle.

10:23 
And he worked. He worked in the farm for just two years. And then he went to work for the post office.  And he retired from the post office here about four years ago. 

10:41 
And how about your own family? Your wife? 

10:46 
Oh, my wife, she worked and she retired four years ago. The last 20 years she spent working, she was  a medical secretary at at a hospital in Nampa. And I have a son that was born at the Minidoka  relocation center. And he is teaching. He's a math teacher at Nampa high school. The high school that  he graduated from he went back after five years of schooling, went back to teach and that's the only  place he's taught. His wife is also a teacher. And she's raising a family now. So she's not teaching the  last few years. She… have two grandchildren four and eight, going on, he will be shortly. 

11:45 
In respect to your family of origin. Do you feel that your parents raised you more along Japanese  traditional longer American than others? 

11:55 
The only Japanese traditional lines was in did send me to, you know, to Japanese language school  which the people the community of Bellevue built on their own. No government funding and that  Japanese language school which was one day a week. And then he entered me in judo classes. We  had a Bellevue dojo, which was a judo club. And that was in existence from about 1935/36 until the war  started. And I did that, and I did get a first degree black belt before the time I graduated high school.  But aside from that, no, there was nothing we… they raised us as Americans. 

12:52 
And how about your son, your sense that you instill traditional values? 

12:57 
Yes. Yes, that part is the one thing I have insisted on and taught him when he was growing up as  crucial years was to respect the law. Have respect for teachers, and any government official, you know,  and treat everybody like you'd like to be treated yourself. And he had no problem making friends. Like I  said, I moved quite a bit there until I settled down to my present residence. Seemed like about every  four years I was moving to another house, another farm. And, um… but by the second day, he'd bring  people kids over his age and he knew them all. He knew all the kids on the street, he had no problem.  He's one of the very few, he was the only student in school during his great school days. Nampa high  school when he graduated in 1962, there was only three other Japanese American students in the  class. He's the very first person of Japanese descent to teach in the Nampa school system. There was  a little little trouble getting started. But no, he's teaching math, it's only teaches. Once a trouble, it was a  little hard to get a job. I imagine it was partly because of his Japanese descent. But in four years after  he started, he was voted the most outstanding educator in the Nampa school system, which I was quite 
proud of. And he's been an officer and in the National Education Association held various offices. Think  he served as president one term. 

14:55 
What was the community like when you first… (unintelligible)? 

14:57 
The area around Nampa and Caldwell. They were needing us bad, as far as workers. I did get, should I  say thrown out, I was out of a restaurant on two different occasions. One was on the Fourth of July  1943. And that was in Nampa. Then one was in Jerome, Idaho, when I went to the camp Minidoka to  visit my mother and sister there. I stopped, it was a noon hour.

15:37 
So I thought I'd stop and my wife and my son was about year and a half years old. 

15:46 
Stopped at a restaurant there and didn't get waited on. And finally the waitress came over and said, Are  you Japanese? And I said Japanese descent Yes. Well, we don't serve you. So I think she was more  embarrassed than I was. But we left on a couple of blocks and look like much nicer restaurant went in  there and never paid us any different attention and waited on us. And from there on after any town or  city I went to, I always looked up the best restaurant there was in town seemed like we got better  treatment. Kind of, you know, try to hold back and didn't go to the best one. Went to a nice clean  looking one about it. But I knew it wasn't the best in town. But my experience has been since then. But  it isn't true now. But those days going back to the 40s. That was true. 

16:42 
Was the prejudice more pronounced in restaurants? Or did you experience it? 

16:46 
Mostly in restaurants. I would say that I was fairly well received. And presently I'm well known. 

16:58 
How has the Nampa and Caldwell area changed? 

17:04 
Well, it's changed in populations grown so much the two towns are almost together now. City Limits.  One side says Welcome to call when other side says Welcome to Nampa. 

17:16 
They are only eight miles apart. I would say that we are pretty well accepted. There's a few that are  ignorant. That's, you know, you'll find that no matter when or where you go. 

17:36
But if they get to know us, I think that's the main thing. I've been trying to educate everybody I get a  chance to forget to three people who listen to me I tell them about my experiences. I didn't do that. A  few years back, but more recently I have 

17:52 
Why do you think that you've achieved? 

17:54 
Well, I think grown getting older and and I changed my mind about a lot of things. I thought, forget it.  Forget about the past, but I've been thinking it's more important to tell the story to the public. I think if  they understood us, they will understand us if you tell them the story. I personally have been well  accepted being in a business that like I said earlier that no one no Japanese Americans ever started.  Just a very few just a handful even today, one in Seattle. And it was couple in Los Angeles. That's the  only ones now there's several. I was well accepted by my fellow proprietors I served 12 year term  continuous, secretary treasurer of the Southwest aero bowling proprietors Association, the 1981 82 I  served a year term as a president of the Idaho proprietor association may sound like I'm bragging but I  did. I was invited as a member of the service club. And after about four years, I served six year term as  secretary treasurer of the Exchange Club of Napa and upon my retiring, I have a life membership in the  exchange club. I also have a life membership in the morning proposed Association of America for my  30 odd years is continuous membership. And in the bowling business, bowling career, I blocked you  Three local halls of fame. I belong as a charter member of the Nampa men's bowling Association Hall  of Fame in 1971, and in 73, I was a member of the Idaho scratch voters Association, Hall of Fame. And  then 1985 I was voted into the idol bowling Council Hall of Fame No, I've never owned a 300
