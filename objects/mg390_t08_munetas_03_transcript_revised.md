It'll be interesting part of what family was wanting to do. Being a small we were saying mid sized or  smaller family. But if it was a bigger family I could see… you had to have about eight or 10 before you  got to apartments, five and six, seven were crowded into one. But you know 10,000 in a mile square  and barracks type housing at one time in a Minidoka was the third largest city and state of Idaho. The  high, the high school they had a high school for two they graduated two classes in Minidoka. And it was  the biggest High School in the county.

(unintelligible) 

01:28 
Oh to leave the camp. You had to get clearance first. And they gave you a pass and you presented at  the gate there was only one entrance to the camp guarded course 24 hours a day by by army  personnel. That you showed them that you got the clearance to go. And if you had your own  transportation you could have gone but most of them had to go by bus. There was a daily bus left the  camp went to Twin Falls, which about a half hour ride one way and then brought you back towards  evening. So by your personal things, you know that you wanted, although there was canteens in the  camp itself that personal needs were you could buy. They fed you and three times a day but anything  else you had to have on your own. You had to get on your own. One thing you didn't like about it was in  hot or cold weather you had to line up to eat breakfast and lunch and dinner and you had to wait to take  turns getting your laundry done. You had to wait to the latrines we call them in line. And the lack of  privacy and breaking up to families is probably the hardest thing to endure.  
Tempers tempers would flare Yes, when you're cramped in that kind of quarters. It's natural. You know.  Brothers and brothers, brothers and sisters are probably I never had any problem. My family but I've  heard where they did have. And it was because they was put together so close together for so long  without the privacy. I imagine that was the main cause. But there was a hospital furnished you know  and there was after they got settled. They had a Community Recreation Center where you could play  games and ping pong and stuff like that. They had a high school gym, they even played basketball and  baseball and softball at Minidoka. They went and played the local teams around there.  
Were you involved in them?  
No, I wasn't I wasn't in

04:00 
(unintelligible) 

04:10 
Okay, that's you that was I was approached by channel to the CBS affiliate in Boise to be interviewed  about my experiences in Camp Minidoka and my evacuation experience. And the young lady that  called me to ask if I'd be willing to, gave me her name. And her last name… I just asked her Did you  happen to have a father by that name? You know, that lived in Nampo. She said yes. And I said what is  first name be such and such, said yes. She's How do you know I said well, he worked for me in 1952- 53 when I was farming. This young lady is 23 or four now and she did the interviewing. So it was real  small world. Then the manager of the station, channel two, the young man and his father happened to  be a 19 year old MP, and he guarded us at Camp Minidoka. And so we went to Minidoka. And on site, I  was interviewed. Myself, my wife and my sister and her husband, the four of us were interviewed there.  That was two years ago, 

05:38 
(unintelligible) 

05:41 
He is the father of the manager of the station. 

05:45 
Was this one you're talking about was that (unintelligible)? 

05:48 
Yes, he went and served as guards on two other relocation centers. And he said Minidoka center was  the easiest one easiest job, he had no problems whatsoever there. He had some problems with the  other one. Other people involved and he would have people would come in, with a people from Twin  Falls came, we went to Twin Falls. And like I said, I went to a restaurant there and a little baby in my  arms and a son and they brought, you know, baby chair for him and weighed on us. And it was real  good. I got treated. Only just a couple of instances when I was refused services, only thing I could  remember. I've been well received, well received everywhere. Maybe I've been fortunate because I've  talked to people that didn't experience that, you know, I had some bad experiences. But I've been  fortunate I, only for once or twice been kicked out of a restaurants. 

06:50 
Why was people in the camp asked to go out for food for those as well, if you want to go back? 

06:59 
We could only go back on a permit. This was not to permanently go out. The permanent leaves did not  come about until 1943-44. Then they were trying to, the government wanted us to go up. They knew  that there was a mistake made that there never was a necessity for these camps. And so, you know,  after the first one year after the war, well, then they were trying to get us up and relocate us and they 
they helped relocating. A lot of them went to Chicago. Chicago had a population of 20,000 former camp  internees at one time, I don't know what the population is now.  
Why Chicago?  
I don't know why Chicago, more so than New York, more so than any other major city in the Midwest.  Although former evacuees are in every city in the country now. Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland. St. Louis.  Denver has a big population. 

08:14 
One of the reserves wondering what types of thoughts and feelings you recall having while you're in  camp, part of the reason for using there was some sort of suspicion about your country. How did it feel? 

08:33 
I was bitter to be put in camp without being charged with anything. I didn't think that, I thought maybe  my mother, being an alien, might be but she didn't know anything. She was illiterate anyway. But being  a citizen and without being charged of any wrongdoing, just because we were Japanese to be picked  up and told to be a certain place and put in camp without a hearing or anything I knew was wrong. But  the, we did have a few leaders, Japanese leaders. And they decided to go along with the order and not  give them any problems any trouble that way by having to have less guards, you know, during  evacuation period and help the war effort that way to go along peacefully. I think today, if the same  thing happened you're gonna have all kinds of trouble. But we were a young population. And many of  the leaders at that time affiliated with the JCL have been criticized In the past years, and I, I don't go  along with that. I think they did the right thing to help 

10:14 
Each other almost like their willingness to go along here was proof of the patriotism. 

10:23 
Patriotism and try not to give him any problem, because if it did, just imagine what it would be if you had  every community in on the West Coast and three West Coast states rioted or stuff like that refuse to go,  there's only three that refused to go. And they did it on their own. And they knew they were going to be  picked up. But they were testing the law. And they all three have been vindicated since. But it took a  long time. It only been last two or three years that they were, the Supreme Court okayed it, but they  spent two three years in jail in order to do that. Of course, they were all lawyers that, more or less  reason they were testing it. 

11:07 
How old were you? 

11:09 
23. I was 23. 

11:14
What happened to the people that didn't want to go along with the orders? 

11:23 
To relocate? Well, the government helped them get back to wherever they wanted to go. But when they  closed the camp, they had to go someplace. 

11:37 
Supposing in camp, still a problem? Some people didn't want to be there. I know some people didn't  like what was happening. What was one of the guards to help them? 

11:52 
Well, if they didn't want to go there, you you are allowed, eventually you're allowed to leave. But of  course, they weren't in a situation they weren't able to leave, financially, because most of us lost  everything. And we hadn't got anything back at that time. So but if they were able to when they had a  place to go to most of them left. There was a few that didn't want to go and they stayed there until the  cancer closed. I really don't know exactly how they dealt with those few people. There was a few 100. 

12:33 
unintelligible 

12:40 
Tule Lake was, Tule Lake was the center that most of the dissidents, I should say, those that didn't  want to go out, didn't want to relocate. And some of them want to repa-.. repatriate to Japan. Some did  some wanted to. They were all kept at the Tule Lake center until it was closed. 

13:05 
I think one of the questions that was asked, for example, someone in (unintelligible) was trying to  escape or causing some problems with that person who can particularly? 

13:15 
If yes, if there was such a person but to my knowledge and never once they said those were to protect  us but you know, those machine guns were aimed at the camp inside not away from the camp. There  never was one attempt to leave hunt camp or the Minidoka Center. One of the boundaries was a pretty  big pretty deep in the summertime irrigation canal. And I know if you could swim it, you could have got  across but you're going off to a desert. I don't know if you to, rattlesnakes and takes himself out there in  the desert. And there were some camps I guess there was some attempts, but I've read about them,  but in the Minidoka camp there was no such incident. 

14:07 
You mentioned earlier and one of the reasons that has motivated you to tell this story right now is that  you want to counteract some misconceptions people. What misconceptions…? 

14:28
Oh, there's a few that thought that we would be disloyal, you know, fifth column activities where we're  supposed to be going on the citizen spying for Japan, this kind of stuff weren't trusted. And some of  them have the idea that we were pampered and coddled into camps, which is not true. We made the  best of it. The relocation centers were more permanent. They were in existence for three, four years at  the longest. The assembly centers all along the west coast., were temporary. A lot of them had to make  to all the given was a mattress casing and you fill it up with straw for your bed. Portland assembly  center was Multnomah Fairgrounds, the Seattle area Tacoma area went to Piuyallup. Western Idaho I  mean Western Washington fairgrounds at Puyallup. They made the horse stalls and barns into  temporary shelters. Santa Anita was another one. Racetracks and fairgrounds were converted into  assembly centers temporary, so the accommodations weren't good. 

16:01 
A lot of people know that (unintelligible) talked about the purpose of the assembly? 

16:07 
That was when the order was given to evacuate, they had to have a place to keep the people for a  while while these relocation centers were being built. And the War Relocation Authority had to build the  centers more permanent, more further inland. They were in a hurry to herd all the Japanese Americans  together on the three West Coast states and keep them under surveillance. So they were just a barbed  wire enclosure with people in their hastily put together barracks. Pine Dale, Camp Pine Dale just north  of Fresno, just outside the city of Fresno 

16:53 
(unintelligible) 

16:58 
I don't know what happened to them, they were gone when I got back to my place. Three years later,  On the farm…? 
Everything my I left my farm equipment, my irrigation system, pump pipes, sprinkler system, a lot of  gardening tools and all my fam home furniture and beds and everything. And turned it over to a man  I've known for a long time and gave him the key.  

17:40 
When I went back two and a half years later, and it wasn't the same person in the house on the farm.  But he showed me a government bill of sale for everything that I had left. It was in his name, so I  couldn't claim it. He wouldn’t let me touch anything. And so I never went back. I didn't have anything to  go back to. That was my reason that I settled in Idaho. I did want to go back at one time. I go back to  visit every year a couple of times a year, was most of my friends and people I went to school with went  back to Bellevue and Seattle. Bellevue, at the time of evacuation about 50 families. There's only about  well, I take it back. There's a lot of families there but it's not the same type of family there who work in 
Seattle and there's a lot of people in Bellevue now. The people that former residents of Bellevue aren't  back in Bellevue. They live in Seattle. Probably half a dozen families live and live in Bellevue that used  to live there before and they're scattered all over the country. 

18:50 
How did you How does somebody who had everything taken from them and how started all over again.  How did you do that? 

19:01 
Well just had to at all. We left camp with a suitcase just an overnight cases all I had. My wife and I got  married she had a little overnight case. They were all her belongings and then mine was all in my  suitcase. Talking about starting up from scratch, you couldn't 

19:21 
That was a requirement that you could only carry? 

19:22 
That's was a requirement just what suitcase you could carry. Everybody was allowed a suitcase so just  a little one. It wasn't that big. 

19:38 
Yes, I was one of the very first couples to be married at Tule Lake. I was married in August 23rd Nine  teen to get this right to do 42 1942 August 23. And there was only one other couple that we married on  the same day. 

20:10 
I'm a Buddhist. But I got made by a Baptist minister and had to get a marriage license in the county that  Tule Lake is relocated is located in MODOK. County, California. 

20:34 
Was the minister was in a camp…?  
He was also evacuee. There probably was a Buddhist Reverend terrified of taking the time to find out  but there was we didn't we didn't check into it that much. The bouquet a flight for the flowers, a bakery  truck that service the camp canteens from Klamath Falls 35 miles away. I ordered through the canteen  and had some had, did have a bouquet of flowers and had a little cake. The rest was menu for the for  the day at the camp at the our block. The camps were built in blocks.
