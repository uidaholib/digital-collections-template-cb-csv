Whoever some had less or less than his father didn't have two weeks, they probably have 24 hours. So  we get people in people in. Okay. It 

00:28 
was the interim period before the order of evacuation? 

00:31 
I don't remember exactly. But after we knew definitely that we were going to have to leave. And then we  were never told where we were going. This was another thing we were never told where we were going  didn't know our destination. This is roughly around two weeks, when a definite word came that we had  to leave, we weren't going to be able to stay the summer. We had talked about it ever since December  7, but it was middle of May when I left. And we had to just about two weeks notice to get everything in  to get all your business in order, dispose of anything. I sold a refrigerator for $5. So pick up like T 36  model Ford pickup for $50. And a man who was, I considered a good friend, treated with me at a  service station. Where I figured it was a good friend. He said I will send you the other 25 When you let  me know when you get there your address, which I did. I never did see him again. So I got $25 for a  1936 pickup. That was in real good shape. Of course it was five years old. I had a 1939 ton and a half  truck I got $400 for. Didn't get anything for the rest of the equipment. Just had to leave it there didn't  have time to sell it or any household goods we just boarded up in a house and and left it he was only  allowed to take a suitcase a piece. So we left with with just what we could carry. 

02:30 
(unintelligible) 

02:34 
Certain areas of the country. Terminal Island area in our Los Angeles was given 24 hours to leave.  Bainbridge Island across the sound from Seattle was given, I don't know how long they were given. But  it was very short compared to the rest of the area around Seattle.  

03:05 
You mentioned how much you were getting to the cost versus others. 

03:10
Well, we were I myself now the government, doubt a government representative. In this community that  I lived in, there was a company formed to take over the farms. And they dealt with each farmer on  separately each one. And I wanted to hold up for more but I just figured out the seed and the fertilizer  and part of the labor involved in it and got out. I was paid, I had 13 acres all in crop all truck crops.  Peas, lettuce, cauliflower, celery, strawberries, beans. I got $100 an acre. Those that took that over that  summer got well rich on it because everything was 1,000% higher retail, wholesale price wise of  vegetable crops on the Seattle market, at least 1,000%. So they made money, but they didn't know how  to farm. So next year. There was no farm. 

04:32 
So now you're getting $100 an acre. 

04:36 
Three, four or 5000 or more. The government finance, this group didn't the government never probably  never did get their money back. I don't know going back that far. They disbanded they couldn't farm.  They stepped in and formed an organization to buy my crops, my neighbor's crops in this community.  They were able to harvest it somehow. But after that they never went back to farming. They just looked  let the farms go, they were never farmed there for three or four year period. 

05:15 
What does it mean for you right now, to be a Japanese American? 

05:21 
I'm proud to be a Japanese American. Now. I wasn't, I was always proud of that. But it meant a lot of  trouble during the war years. But having weathered the storm and went through all the troubles, and  getting through it, you know, in good shape. I always say that I'm proud to be a Japanese American.  Mainly because of the record of the soldiers who went and volunteered for the service. And the record  they came back with. 442 and 100 battalion from Hawaii. Our Nisei a congressman, and in Washington  DC, the last 10 years or more, the work that they do… I'm not ashamed to be an American of Japanese ancestry know. 

06:28 
How do you feel that you have gone to influence the community on how to build your community? 

06:40 
That's kind of a hard question to answer, but I think influence the community by, my when I got into the  bowling industry, the bowling business that was a small Bowling Center. I was the second proprietor in the whole state of Idaho that put in automatic pinsetters. Before then it was pin boys, you know, hand  set. And in 1981, build a new 24 Lane center with all the latest equipment from the ground up. So it  gave the community a recreation that was second to none in that area. And got to know the people in  the country, the farmers and merchants as sponsors and the bowling public. And got to meet a lot of  people, made a lot of friends. Which I wouldn't have if I stayed in farming, I'm sure. That's why as a  Japanese American, I'm more visible in the community because I was in business. In fact, I was the  only one in the business of any kind in the city. And as far as a community. They've supported my business venture and have helped me along all these years. And I could I think I could say I was well  respected in the community. I'm happy with the situation as I am now. Yes. I'm glad I relocated in  Nampa. 

08:42 
Do you feel that Idaho is any different… (unintelligible)? 
I think Idaho. You know, I took me one year is all. It was so much hotter than Seattle, in the summer,  the first year I spent on. And the winter was so cold compared to what I was used to. But after that one  year and getting used to the weather, the climate, I like it. I prefer it much more than Seattle. I was  talking to some friends the other day. And this came up because of the San Francisco earthquake last  Tuesday. That I'd rather live in Nampa than anywhere else or in Idaho someplace in anywhere else,  especially Western Idaho. And it's because of the climate and the people. I would rather live I wouldn't  go anywhere now. And I visited quite a bit of places quite a few places. So California I've been to  several times, I've been to Oregon and naturally Seattle every year a couple of times. And I don't think  I'd like to go anywhere else. Make my home here in Idaho.  
Do you speak Japanese? 
I speak a little Japanese. I used to be able to speak quite fluently at one time. But right after the war, it  was better that you didn't know how to speak Japanese. If you spoke to Japanese they figured he was  Japanese from Japan. There's a lot of people out there yet, this nation across this nation, that doesn't  
differentiate me from Japanese citizen of Japan. If you're not familiar with it that I run into this, some  people ask me my wife while she was working a fellow worker here a few years back asked her what  language you speak at home she says English you know that's a stupid questions you work with her all the time. 

10:55 
There are a lot of more are surprised to hear that my son is a teacher. And that's nothing new now. But  I mean, he's, he's one of the earlier ones that taught school. He was going to be a doctor he couldn't  stand the sight of blood so he decided to better be a teacher instead. He started out college as a,  wanting to become a doctor at one time. Taurus I guess in his young days younger than that when he  was 10 or 11, friends would ask him what you're going to be in so I'm going to be a bowling proprietor.  And I talked him out of that but he was going to be a doctor and he took two years of biology and got so  he couldn't stand the sight of blood I said you're never going to be a doctor if you can stand the sight of  blood you better change your major and go into math and biology 

11:58 
They have everything. Very spoiled. 
(unintelligible) No, I don't think I do. Maybe my wife does. They're learning everything: piano tap dancing, ballet and  swimming lessons. Course they're young yet. The older older older of the two is only going, he will be  eight here in January. But kept busy all the time. 

12:33 
Any traditional Japanese ever developed all American? 

12:38 
All American except two years ago. The community of Ontario has a big Japanese population. And they  have a Buddhist church. And they have what they call a Bon Odori in the fall. So my granddaughter did.  But as took a party in that, learning to dance when she was six years old, five and six. And I bought her  a Japanese kimono on one of my trips. Well, my only trip back to Japan in five years ago. I brought this  
back for her so she could dance in. But she didn't dance this last fall. Things are getting older, a little  more self conscious. But she's taking ballet lessons. 
You know, I would hate to see all of it lost. But I think it's going to take a background to it. In your small  communities, it would it's much more easier to lose that Japanese culture. If you go to your major cities  like Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco it'll be kept up I'm sure. The reason for that being those major  cities are getting people from Japan constantly, you know immigrating, no the dances, know all these  things. But you get to small farming community. Like in most parts of Idaho, you don't have that. So  your events eventually disappear 

14:39 
I think it would be a shame to completely disappear. But there's a lot of good things, a lot of good  culture from Japan. That mixed with American culture, it would help you know. But I think the most  important thing that I I taught my son was to respect the law. He's never got a traffic ticket. Never got a  parking ticket even that I know, of course, parking meters are out now in Nampa and Caldwell, but they  used to have them. Never got a speeding ticket. And he's a careful driver. And you don't see the  Japanese names on the police blotter in our town or in Boise, Nampa, Caldwell. Never. I've been asked  by lawyers and judges How come and I tell them the same thing I'm saying now. Respect for law and  order is one of the main things that we teach them when they're kids, so they don't get into trouble once  in a while they do. You can't say there isn't any you go to your major cities. They've got gangs, Los  Angeles, San Francisco, any big city, Seattle even getting that way. But I think it's an environment to  grow up. And of course, even  
In the camp where the family structure kind of broke down? 
That did break down. Yes, it hurt a lot of a lot of them there. Some of them left their home earlier. They went out to school, went off to college is from the camp. I think if it wasn't for evacuation and in the  internment centers, the families would have stayed together longer. 

16:30 
Because that tradition was still handed down? I think so. I've talked to some that did hand it down.  Some that didn't get it.

16:43 
I'm out of formal questions. Are there any things? We haven't touched upon? That he thinks it's  important? 

16:50 
No, I don't. Would you have any questions?  
You said it's interesting. You said earlier that you felt it was right for you. Definitely go along with that  order.  
Yes. Once the order was given, I didn't think it was. It would have been to no avail to fight that order.  You can't fight the army. It was the Justice Department. But the US Army and the War Department is  the one that did the actual evacuating. And the soldiers that guarded us, you know, they had rifles and  bayonets and it would have been foolish to attempt to escape or to defy the order. For a short time…  There the there was talk of maybe we would not go, try not to go. And they met with the War  Department in San Francisco. Japanese leaders who've been blamed for it many times, even even  today, but they decided the best war effort they could do would be to go peacefully, like I said earlier  today, and cause less trouble for the government. That way to go peacefully than defy it, we could have  fought it. To round up 100,000 people, men, women and children and put them in a camp. There was a  big job, especially with the scarcity of scarcity of transportation and material on account of the war  started. I think that they done as good a job as it could possibly do at that time, bad as conditions were.  I didn't like the conditions, but looking back at it now it was probably as good as they could do. In a lot  of places, it could have been better. The only experience I had was with a camp that had less  problems. And I went in after the camps were settled. I wasn't one of the first ones to go to a camp. A  lot of the first contingent that went had to go in and fix the camp up and help fix a camper and get it  ready for occupancy. I wasn't one of those. I was lucky I went to when it was well settled. So my  experiences are different than those that first opened it up.
