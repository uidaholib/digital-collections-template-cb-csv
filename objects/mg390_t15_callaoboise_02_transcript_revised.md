00:11 Like if I ask, what are some of the things that Filipinos do together? Or or with the rest of the  community? What kind of activities are they involved? In? 

00:30 I can't remember these these, like, well, just like when they have affairs here in the park or anything like  that, or the RPC bars and fair, the State Fair guarantee. They don't. They don't cooperate in a way like  doing something but they, they like, those selling things they sell. That's what it is there. 

01:04 Are there are many nurses in Boise, Filipino nurses? 

01:09 I know. I know. One. One that I really know here in Boise. And some are retired already. So like, but  then in Nampa, or something like that. But I know one here in Boise. lady. 

01:32 She used to nurse right, well, how 

01:35 How about you? 

01:36 Well, I was just, like, nursing aide or something like that. But I have worked in the hospital for a long,  long time. 

01:44 But when by the time you came to Boise, were you? 

01:48 I was still working in California to Yes, to help him because you know how it is? 

01:58 When When did you? When and where did you meet?

02:01 San Francisco. 

02:04 Can you talk a little bit about your? 

02:07 Oh, yes. Well been in here when he came here in, in fact, he came in California. You know how  Filipinos don't have a good job, they just get as bus boys and, and house boy and all that. See, you can  get the job right away. And at that time, he was waiting on a table on, on, on the hospital. And in the  hospital, hotel, whatever you are, whether in a hotel, in a hotel, and he goes to church, then I go to  church, and now we met at the church. That's where we met, the church. But really, when he comes to  church, he felt he the church is over. He lives. And that is for a while long time I know him before a long  time. And we never even get together until when it was time probably that we have to meet 

03:16 the mean when faith  
Yes 
Destined for you to meet? 

03:19 
And yeah. And that decision. When we first met, it was in 1932. And, of course, we were friends, we  were friends, boyfriends, you could say boyfriends. And at the time, he was volunteering in this this  religious work. And I was really cooperating with him i and the and the people think that it was it was  really a nice pair to pair to be working like that. In fact, it did the volunteer work that he was doing. We  have even more more congregation than then when we have our own church. So then in, we got  married in 1976. And we were poor you know, at that time, because he was going to in this seminary,  he was going to the seminary. We were poor. And when we got married couldn't believe it? My town  mates from whoever this guy. I'm from Norway, skya. Salon. They were the one who even sponsor our  party so that we could get married and have a nice time. 

04:47 
Did you have a nice day? 

04:49 
We did have a nice time. And we were married by a Presbyterian Filipino minister also 

05:00 
No, wait, let me ask why. Why is it you had a fresh Filipino Presbyterian minister? 

05:08 
There was a Filipina Presbyterian minister, but it was he was not in. He was in Sacramento.

05:15 
So what I'm trying to ask really is, were you in a situation where the Filipino Presbyterians were  separate from the white American Presbyterians… 
No  
Worshippers, or? 

05:28 
it's just that it's just that we decided to have a group of our own. And then, like I said, the group that we  have was intermarriages. They're Mexican, and Japanese and all that stuff. And so well, he preached in  English began at that time, so that everybody will understand. The there was a church, a Filipino church  in Salinas. And in San Jose, that's where he was stationed in San Jose, we were there for 10 years,  then he was transferred to, to Salinas, for we've been there for 18 years. Then he was there, before  before you went to the seminary, also to, to, there was an old old group that they started, but it was  never. It was never was that going on. So they sent him there to revive that before he went to the  seminary. So all in all, he was really working, almost says 1932 in all that. 

06:57 
So it sounds like he devoted his life. Most of his active working life to the church.  Yes. 

07:04 
That's one of the years you folks came to this country. What year did you come to this country? 

07:09 
He came in 1928. And I came in 1925. 

07:14 
With with all of your family or? 

07:17 
I came, I came with a nephew and a cousin. 

07:22 
And how did how did you get to come here? Can you talk about that a little bit? 

07:25 
my see, I have a nephew that was here. And he came for a vacation. And he said, when he went to  came to the Philippines to do the lockers, yeah, whoever was this guy. And he said that, you know, in  the Phillipines, in America, he says, education is better there. Because you will have well, they call this  A, A and B, you know, that he got it to two promotions, promotions. So I said, Well, maybe I like to see how he does, you know. And of course, my parents did not agree or make I mean, but my mind was  just like, am I enough? Boy? Yeah, boy, that I did not realize how sad I was until I really left my parents. 

08:31 
So this was in the 1930s. When you came? Was it? How difficult was it to to come to the United States  from the Philippines? Oh,

08:42 
Oh, that was very, it was easy. You we have to ride on boat on the boat.  
It was it was did you say it was easy?  
Yeah, that's nothing new. There's no questions that like now, you know, like now you have to 

08:58 
go. So the immigration policies…? 
Tat wasn't there at that time. However, at the same time, at about that time, it was very difficult for the  Chinese and the Japanese. That time come to this country. It's about that time and very interesting that  you point out was 

09:16 
When he came my nephew came there are no leaders as long as we had the transportation. Okay, we  just came like you came from Moscow 

09:24 
to here. Is that the same for Reverend Callao?  

09:27 
How did you do that? 

09:29 
Was it also easy for you to come to America? Yes. 

09:35 
My sir. I mean, and and then when I saw that I could do something better there than in the Philippines.  So I stay 

10:07 
and stay in the place where I could I could go to school see, because I was just alone by myself, House boy… 

10:35
So I got, my I got somebody to to, be their house, house boy see so I got that yeah easy. 

11:06 
Work you can get anyway 

11:09 
So when I was in the in the house boy, I I did not just do like that I went to school that way I want to get  school I want to get a job 

11:39 
in such a way that I could go to school also and that I have been a little bit better and then it's better for  me because I could go to school that way Yes. 

12:12 
How would the people you work for, how did they treat you or how was your relationship with, with  these people? 

12:21 
Well it's good. That the that type any rigid rigid say they as a matter of fact they help me on also in my  school… (unintelligible) 

12:53 
at about that time did you know any other people from Asia like the Japanese and the Chinese? 

13:02 
No, not at the time. It was only Fillipinos. 

13:19 
So go good in that kind of because the Filipinas. Coming there are education 

13:36 
in money also, I guess most of them really game for money. 

13:42 
Which is what many immigrants come for. 

13:45 
Like when they like in the 19th century. I say 1990 90 or something like that. They they have there were  a group of Filipinos that were attracted to come to this country through Hawaii, they go Hawaii first and  then come this way. And that's how many Filipinos came here and all they do or what they they have  landed on the schoolboys in porters in what a little work that they can get because 
That's all they can it's all
They can find they can find and get no little money 

14:32 
okay. What what do you think brings people to Idaho? 

14:40 
I know. Well, what I know is most of them are in the service. And when the, well we have a base here  you know in my in Mountain Home and whenever they retired they or even if they don’t retired, they like  to live here in Idaho. And then not only that, not only from these people from either from Mountain  Home, there are many from other states. And they would be stationed to Idaho. And in Boise, then they  come this way and live here. Many retiring up here.  
I wonder why?  
Yeah, I, I don't know why. But to me, when we decided to come to Idaho, being a small place, you feel  more at home, because you can live… Well, that is how I felt anyway. That's how I felt that I like a  smaller place. You are away from so many activities, you know, all in filing California, for we were all  you have is all these activities like many other like Oregon and Washington. 

16:04 
Like the other bigger cities? Yes, 

16:06 
yes. And we cannot do that anymore. That's why it's okay. That we were here. 

16:12 
We have heard that Filipinos have a very high intermarriage rate. Can you comment on that? 

16:22 
That's what I can see. That's what I can see. Because my son is married to an American. And my, my  other son is married to Japanese. And my other son is married to American. I mean, my daughter is  married to American… pictures. Yeah, she married to American. So that's what it is. I don't have any  pure Filipino children. 

16:55 
Why why do you think that is so? Yeah, good question. 

16:59 
Well, the reason? Well, I really can't say anything about that. But I think the reason is that we don't  have many of our people in here. Or I can say that because in the West Coast, there are many Filipinos  see, but I really don't know because that's what that's going on. But you see, when he was still a  minister in California, the early part of his ministry, they did not allow marriages, intermarriages like that.  So, so he cannot marry. So we have been bringing these people who wants to marry another  nationality to Reno. In fact, we had brought about seven of them.

17:56 
So when you say they can you clarify that who would not allow? 

18:02 
The law below in California, California, California, maybe maybe in United States? I didn't know how I  didn't know this. But in California, they didn't. It was not allowed for for intermarry. intermarriages, so he  can marry them. So 

18:20 
So Reverend Callao, and you would take them to Reno?  
Yes. 

18:29 
Well, how did you feel about the intermarriage? What do you think of intermarriage? 

18:39 
I well, so far. Like I have been talking to him that in my observation here, although there are many that  we know who are as good as when they are Filipinos, or there are Americans, it's themselves. See,  there are there are many that I know that we deal with that they have the best husbands. They have the  has the they're the best husbands in the American side. Like this lady that I said to her for, course as  ma and pa. He is really very good. And there are many more that I can quote, but they are really  something they're, they are very good. They love their wives, they respect their wives just be Filipinos  in darker colors, you know, and, but they love them. They, they're really proud about them. 

19:38 
As grandparents. How do you feel about your grandchildren being raised perhaps more in an American  way than in a Filipino way? 

19:48 
Now to me, I, to me, I really raised my my my grandchildren, the way the Filipinos Oh, and then like,  does they like doesn't pay my daughter's thing. See my daughter being the only girl in my family in  (unintelligible). Also at the late period I had taken code on her three children from birth. When except  Marissa, she was seven months when my daughter started to work. And I took care of her. And the  twins I took care of them when they were six weeks because see, she cannot have longer leave for for  that. So they I raised them until they were almost three years old. Those twins they're now seven. 

20:42 
So what what do you mean when you say you raise them just like you would raise them? I mean that  you raise them in the Filipino way? 

20:51
Well, what I meant is how I treat my children. That's the way I treated them. And the Father the father  hadn't well I didn't say he has no say, but he never had a say you know how I treated my grandchildren.  The if I scold the children in front of him, that's fine, because they're my children. And that's it. And he's  so good about that. And same thing with my other boys. That's the way I treat them all. But you know in  the other ready to take time to change
