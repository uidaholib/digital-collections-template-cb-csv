and the rotary and you know, some Kolomna, you know, Kuwana, some of these, you know, it is really  interested. And again, maybe, maybe you, maybe your husband was asked, because he, you know,  was close associates with some of 

00:28 
our extensive associations with non Chinese. So sometimes it's how you get hidden. Somebody even  has 

00:37 
actually more so than the more suddenly we're in business. Well, I'm not sure that you were to at one  time, 

00:46 
I'm just one, just wondering if you have to show interest and we have no interest in it. And people, you  know, when they talk about their meetings, you're not interested in listening to what they have to say, or  what their groups do together, then, you know, then they're not about to ask you, you know, they  wouldn't ask me, but I know that I could get into some groups if I wanted to, but I know 

01:07 
I know, in my time, you know, in 26, to whatever, they do not accept Chinese people in their  organization. For one thing, of course, we're always too busy making a living, you know, now, like I did  suggest, I say, we have to work almost twice as hard as the American people would. Well, and we also  save more than what the American people do. You know, like, like, like, they say, you're supposed to  pay 25% of your salary, you know, for housing, and maybe another 25% What is something? A cricket?  Oh, yeah, I got a cricket. That's my friend. You don't count? Yeah, they bring you luck. That Clicks have  been there for quite a while. But that's all right. 

02:13 
Is it really just Chinese or non white is 

02:17
non white? non white? Yes. That's right. It all has to be white. Yeah, you're either white or you colored?  Or you don't get in? Whether that should come out? I don't think that's you know, that's that's even.  situation I don't know about this Chinese history in Idaho, you know? Well, no, 

02:45 
they're gonna ask that again. 

02:47 
Loud you can I don't remember to me. I couldn't 1926 We could have went and visit this lady. Why  1000 

02:58 
The goal is a goal Bemis Bemis. 

03:02 
We could have but we at that time, we didn't know anything about it until it came out in the book, it says  she was still living at the time when we came. You know, if we'd known about it, we certainly would go  visit the house, 

03:15 
you're saying the Idaho history books then would not have included much significant information about  the Chinese. 

03:26 
And at one time, there was a whole gang of Chinese. Just men, all the Greensville after after the mining  was done, they go Dean, you know what I mean, by gleaning, they take what's left. And they anybody  can can can get what's left or know 

03:49 
what's going on? 

03:59 
Well, that book is one I didn't even get to read it until just very recently that my Claire told me about it.  You know, and and I'm very much interested of course, in. In the background, there was, like I said,  there was a group of men, it's mostly men that that have been over here. They leave their wives in  China. For one thing, the red tape. US government will not allow the wife to come over. Except for for  businessmen. If you're a citizen, you cannot bring your wife in here at that time. Not until 1943. I've  been here ever since 1920. But I could not become a US citizen until 1943. Paul Buck was one of the  persons that got this law change in the US government. And so as soon as we were able to join My  husband and I a went to get our citizenship paper at that time. And if you're not a citizen, of course you  cannot buy land or building or anything like that. And so at that time, you have to buy it in your  children's name, because they are citizens and they are allowed to buy. And we cannot even vote all  these years until after we become citizens. And this was in after 1943, about 1943. So how

05:35 
did you, your family acquire property? 

05:39 
Through the through the name of the children? 

05:43 
No mom and Aunt Cora's name. Some of them are born in Canton, so she did not have to be a  naturalized citizen. So therefore, you know, she was born citizen, and then all their property was put in?  Not all of it. Well, at that building here. Well, you know, what have you heard before? 

06:05 
To have to be in my sister's name? 

06:09 
So that's definitely 

06:11 
this doesn't offend anybody. I think a lot of other Caucasians have trouble selling Korea from Chinese  from Japanese. Okay. And you just mentioned a lot of things happened in 1943. But wondering, during  that time, when a lot of Japanese people were being turned around? Yeah, that happened. At 

06:31 
a date, they did not get internet until after the Second World War. That's 

06:39 
39 to 44. With that 41 to 44. 

06:43 
Did you feel Did you feel any pressure 

06:47 
at being Chinese? No, I have no, they were only the government at that time. We're only a after the  Japanese to be in turn. 

06:56 
Were you talking about community pressure? Or? 

07:00 
Oh, no, we have no pressure whatsoever? 

07:05 
How would people identify you as Chinese versus Japanese? I mean, you look alike.

07:11 
Yes. But we can't. We have to have passports, you know, but 

07:14 
if people look, you're in business, are you saying that no one would go away? Because they thought that you're? 

07:20 
Well, I think they were against any oriental, not only Chinese, or Japanese? Because? Because I'm  Chinese. Well, I, they were against us, you see, when they pass us by and go to another restaurant  rather than come in and cater, I mean, trade with us? 

07:45 
Well, again, I think that probably we didn't get we didn't probably suffer through this as much as maybe,  you know, maybe in other areas would have. Because, you know, by that time, if you're saying it's  1943, we my folks had been in business for 

08:00 
since 1926. My father and mother had the head of Russia in 1926 case, so 

08:06 
they had been here for, you know, a long time. So they were very well established. And I knew that they  were Chinese, but I would and the people that were coming here, you know, there might be some of the  students that were coming from, you know, smaller communities that might think. But as a whole, you  know, when you come to the university in the first place, you're usually a little bit more liberal and  accepting. And so in other races, I mean, even even when I was waiting on tables, you know, in the  60s, I'm, there would be occasions where you'd have people just walk by or open the door, see that it's  an oriental restaurant, even though it says, Well, of course, it said the grill Cafe, which people wouldn't  realize, yeah, it but you know, unless you read Chinese American food, and they would walk out and  leave. And that's two weeks, you know, but then you see people walk out of elephants to a restaurant, but 

08:58 
I knew we don't connect that, you know, people walking out of other restaurants, you know, is because  they serve Mexican food. Yeah. Well, they 

09:08 
did this always the other night at jolly Rogers, when we when Linda and I were sitting there, oh, you  know what Frankovich is? And it's just, I mean, they've ever had actually been seated and they walked  out. So to me, that was not any more strange than, you know, I mean, that speaks 

09:23 
well, but if they walked out on a kind of you, then you feel a little bit more than then if you are not the  ones that they walk out of away from. But then since second world war attitude of the American well, especially in Moscow, I think they have changed quite a bit because these soldiers you know, come  back with, with other nations, marry into other I mean, other Japanese or Chinese or whatever, and  then they pick can't accept Chinese food lot more to since since the Second World War? 

10:06 
How about this is a related question in school in history books in particular, or in social studies books? I  think I'll ask Michael Young children how how does the your social studies or history deal with, with the  Chinese? In general, the Oriental? 

10:30 
Oh, no different from other cultures, like Africans? You know, they tell about cultures, they tell the  history, you know, so I don't think he tells about any different Idaho history. You know, I'm talking about  world history, you know, Idaho history, I think it just it it kind of tells about the old Chinese and what  they did like they were more laundry people. And yeah, miners, men and gardeners, 

11:03 
do you feel you're getting sufficient information? If you say you are not Chinese, and you are reading  that, well, how would you feel about your doctor? 

11:22 
Unless you get more of a background of it like reading, was it that 1000 pieces of gold, all it is just oh,  there was trainees here and they were wandering in miners, and that's it. 

11:37 
But there have been there had been? Well, okay, when we were in Idaho history, we didn't have that  much in our head. But you know, they do have some additional materials out now. And I have, you  know, like, for example, encouraged my kids, I think I must have gotten some of these from Priscilla,  about the Chinese or the Orient know, the Chinese and Idaho I think. And so, of course, again, this is  just because of me, but I've encouraged my kids to read, you know, I marked the stories and say,  Okay, you gotta read this, you know, when you're going to bed tonight, and you know, I, and I'm going  out, and I seek these books, and I'm, I'm one of them that was really strong and wanting to bring some  of the books into the library on on Asians. And when I'm making my donations, I, for example, I there's  a heritage book company out of Honolulu, and I'm, my, my donation this year, I'm going to ask them to  send and get some of these, you know, consider some of these books as part of 

12:41 
a larger scale. More important emphasis 

12:45 
emphasis. Well, we are a minority, and I guess we can only have a minority part of the, you know, the  history. Yeah. It probably it would be nice to know him and maybe there just isn't that much information  out? I don't know. But 

13:01
whatever information there is, I think people will get a bigger, broader background on us. Telling us, you  know, telling them that, you know, where your people and we had to come over. I mean, we're, we  weren't brought over because we were slaves or anything. But we were brought over because we  wanted to make some more money, or the ancestors did. 

13:38 
Definitely, the the United States has the best opportunity for everybody and anybody I know, I know  one thing, if a person is is healthy, and willing to work, they never have to starve, not in the United  States, and also in Idaho, because we're, we're thinly populated here. And we are more togetherness  with our neighbors. Like when somebody is hurt and cannot 

14:24 
gather their wheat was the neighbors would go in there and, and help out so everybody's friendly basis.  And that's one thing I find that Idaho and especially Moscow is very good in that relationship with one,  one friend to another. 

14:44 
How would you what do you attribute your success your family success and that extends not just from  your generation, but but your daughters and possibly your grandchildren? So what what would you how  would you attribute the success to? 

15:03 
Well, for one thing, we believe in working hard, and be being honest people in our business association  or in our friendship Association. We believe in that. And also, as far as I know, the Oilers are used to  being at 50 they save more than what our economics people tell us to save is a Oh 10% for the church  and 25% for rent and 25% 25%, for, for food, and so on so forth. Well, we try to do everything at a min  minimum. As far as our health is concerned, of course, we have to spend enough money to keep up  with our health, and to eat correct food, and I'm a home economics. And so I believe in, in buying not  the most expensive food and I don't order the most expensive meal, I just want to order what is best for  my health. The main thing, and I believe in working hard, like like I say, well, we don't, we don't have  too many friends, but what few friends we have, we give our shirt for them and they would give their  shirt to us too for us too. So we don't socialize too much. But we do have some family friends that we  visit with each other and have a good time with each other and mostly over the dinner table. Because  that's the only time we have really spare time is when we eat the other time we have to do our  gardening like my husband like to do gardening and he would raise many Chinese vegetables and then  he would go and clean it up and then deliver them to some of the students some of the faculty people  and he enjoys that which is good. We believe in doing things right for us and as small as far as we can  we do things right for our friends and we try to keep up with the community in their efforts like way you  know who we donate to the United Way we we go to church and we donate to the church people  because we think that they deserve and we enjoy it. So we enjoy our church and and our friends and  our work and we gotta go we really 

18:08
do we have an appointment right now we're supposed to be at another coding session so you go ahead  and finish up here all right. Are you You haven't said anything she got her camera shot okay let's go  sorry. We have they have yes they 

18:33 
have success well I don't I kind of advice would you give newer immigrants the new immigrant 

18:40 
I think they already got that advice from their from their own country. Most of them have that's what we  learn from our own country choose to to work hard. And to be honest. In your in your business  association and be honest with your friends and have have good friends and good family. 

19:08 
Have you been sitting there relatively quiet? No. I've added No, nothing I can think of great
