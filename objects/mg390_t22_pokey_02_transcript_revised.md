It was just after that, well, I lived here being a mechanic I worked here, you know, still The pay wasn't  enough so I'm going right through it fast I've been to Denver, that's where my folks were family in fact,  but I couldn't stand the altitude because I used to smoke at that time a heavy smoker and I just gasped  at night. So I decided to hit with this, I better go elsewhere. Or before I went there I married her. 
How did you meet the two of you?  
Well, this is what happened the Japanese community here the nice as you know, they were held the  dances every once in a while. Well, she didn't have a date and I didn't have a date. And the guy said I'll  get you a good date. So that's how I got to know her 
Was that in Denver?

I tell you she said, boy you're a good dancer. 

02:32 
I win prizes that these dances see so, I'm What are doing she was impressed. Maybe that's why we got  married. 

02:39 
Why did you like her? Did you like her? 

02:43 
Well being musical and I’m musical too. Kind of agreed and a lot of things, only thing I didn't like was  being alone all the time. She's out teaching and I'm home. 

02:56 
So we used to get, I used to play the piano too. And he used to bring his guitar and saxophone, and  we’d fiddle around you know 

03:06 
How did you control her other boyfriends? How did you call her other boyfriends? 

03:11 
Threatened to punch them in the nose and the wave that was a truth. All my opposition, I'd go, are my  competitors are threatened them that was, wasn't fair it wasn't. Well that led to after we got married to  get this won't do we're future here is isn't too good. Well, being a community like Pocatello The pay  wasn't much, cost of living wasn’t much either but then compared to the whole nation, the pay rate was  too low. And we have a grandiose idea. I thought well, I better go to a place where I can get a lot of  money 

03:55
Well before you go to that place. What was Pocatello like at that time? 

03:59 
Oh, we're just pretty good. No, I liked it. The town wasn't very big. 

04:07 
I think there were only about maybe 15,000 people here.  
Yeah, 
At that time. 

04:12 
See, like Yellowstone Avenue, just a dirt path. And if you look at it now it's got malls and everything  else is conditioned, not conditioned. But then it's, it's grown quite a bit. The people are more. I'd say at  that time. A lot of them were were farmers, didn't know too much about the people who's been around a  lot like me. I remember the time I tell you something funny. My neighbor, Caucasian friends, we went  fishing and on the way we stopped at a restaurant and I want to eat some shrimp because it's a shrimp  so much. And the guy poked me you're gonna eat that bug. I said, What do you mean bug? Yeah,  that's a seafood. It's real. Good and the guy said, Well, my mother told me that you shouldn't eat shrimp  for bass bugs. And I ate it, boy with gusto you know? And the guy looked at I said, Boy, that must be  good. You should like it. Don't just be sure I do. He said boy give me a piece. One I said, Hey, this is  good. I can't wait isn't a bug. And a lot of the people were like that. There were a lot of them didn't know  too much. 

05:26 
You saw that. You seem like you were fairly well accepted. 

05:30 
Yeah. It got better and better. See, right after during the war, the people were, that propaganda that  they were throwing out on the radio was pretty bad. Boy I remember? See? Going back to the way we  were treated, at first. It was bad. I don't care what town you were in, they wouldn't cut my hair. You go  to a restaurant sit down. They wouldn't wait on you. Well, we ate at one restaurant, the mother would  push and running woman. Weak ancestry. Well, one day we went in there, there was a drunken there,  he saw us eating. He got on the table start preaching. He says we got to get rid of them. We've got to  kill them, they causing us a lot of trouble. That was us who had nothing just a fork and knife. And the  guy was with he was a Manzanar too. And I told him I said, you know, the book can be attacked not by  one person, but the whole mob in here is whatever you do, don't just let them kill us. Try to take  someone with a fork or a butter knife, doing anything with it. But luckily the lady, she understood our  situation. She went up to the guy and told him that guy could be more American than you are they're  not from Japan. They're not prisoners of war. So why don't you leave them alone? And you know they  all calm down they thought we were from Japan, they were crazy. So you see what the situation was  here.

07:04 
That was here, that incident in Pocatello? 

07:06 
Yeah, see that? Well that they're the people that was in it were, you could sit but see by their face that  they were interested. But I don't think they were aroused again. But it would have been if she hadn't  stopped stepped in and says to leave us alone and they did and then nothing happened after that. That  was the last incident I've had here, other times from then on it seemed like everything was okay. Of  course our customers at this place the place I work with called Blair fried motors they had they were  selling Chrysler product. Some of the customers were nasty. You know, my partner he had to come out  from under under a car he was working on. Got his wrench and went after the guy you should have  seen him school couldn't help but what are you gonna do? You're working,he’s insulting you steadily,  you're not gonna just take it, you know, your emotions will get aroused. And pretty soon you don't know  what to do except to get out and do whatever you think you should do. Things like that happened. That  happened quite a bit all over. In fact, of course, things like that don't happen anymore. But it used to  see you a youngster don't realize that any of you don't realize what happened to us. But right now the  as far Pocatello goes, I think it's a good town. I wouldn't be anywhere else. 

08:32 
I've got a question for you very directly related. Your dad just said that it doesn't happen to the younger  generation these days. So you find that you're being discriminated against? 

08:42 
No, I don't think so. I think you know, if they're if there's any discrimination right now, it's probably more  than a positive one and a negative. I think those that are still continuing to discriminate are probably a  little bit ignorant of the facts. You know, when I say a positive discrimination, I think, I think because of  because of my father and people like him and our grandfathers and they earned the right they earned  that respect, I think from,from this community and the country in general. And so if anything, it's it's  more a matter of pride now to be Japanese, because so much more is expected of you. But it's it's a  wonderful challenge that I think that we're, as a race, I think we're up to 

09:31 
How are your children doing, are they being discriminated against? 

09:33 
No, I again, I feel that they're looked up to they adapt and they accept all of the different races very,  very well. In fact, you know, one of the things that I'm happy to say is that when someone else for  example, a black is discriminated, my children can understand that and they usually side with that poor  unfortunate child. 

10:01 
So you were about to tell us the story of you settling down here. You went to Denver first and then you  came back to?
 
10:08 
Denver. No, I didn't come back and went to their Chicago. That pay we're good but then I couldn't stand  the weather. You know how cold it is next to the Great Lakes. Last, I didn't think were longer than six  months. Because she joined me summer vacation. That was all the rest of time she had to teach. And  then from Pocatello, she came back to teach and then from there, I went to New York City. And I  figured well, the most money I could ever make was getting back into the machinery. So I tried to I had  my papers today, but I wasn't trusted. I had a mark against me, being a radio man see? And boy then  everything about what I did while I was in the tuna boat, working on tuna boats. They even had an  incident where see a firm in New York City wanted to get someone to be a buyer a broker get down  there buy some alligator skin they offered 80 cents a square foot. So I thought boy that's a good deal I  can make a lot of money knowing that a lot of alligators here this was in Costa Rica as a country it just  above Panama. So I accepted that and I went in to see the country, you know the area see what was  going on but on the way in it's all in the interior that Spanish called interior and took about three days to  get. In the meantime, going in. I started get stomachache know that see? And the food I was eating too.  And the water drinking out a river I got Tucker, malaria and dysentery. And when I got to the camp, to  the alligator camp where they store skin had a shortage showed me the warehouse open that door that  stench come out. And it knocked me over boy I puke and everything else. And then I was sick from  then on. And I said boy, if I have to contend with this, I don't want any part of it. And I went back and  landed in the hospital. See? Well, they had all that information but it wasn't me looking for alligators, it  was that I was scouting for the Japanese Imperial Air Force for for now. airfield in Costa Rica being  close to Panama City. And it was so funny. I laughed when I said What do you mean? I'm not a spy. My  folks had never been to that time. They've never been to Japan never had seen it. I can’t be enemy  aliens. My folks have never been to Japan. I've been to Japan but as as a student see? And I'm three  generations here. So you just have to take my word for it. And you know, a month or so later I was  cleared. It was okay. Then. After the war. Oh, it wasn't too long. I went out to sea again. You don't build  your studio. Before I went to see. I did them.  
Yeah, I think so. 

13:33 
When did you finally settle here? And 

13:36 
When did I settle? After 1948 then I stayed after that.  

13:47 
How has the community changed since you've been here? 

13:52 
Well, I think it's it was like any other community here. Became more open, due to I still say I hate to say  it but I say because of Japan's status you know, prestige. They're not they're not a dumb race. They’re  a smart race and all that it's helped the Nisei a lot Don't you think so? You being a Nisei, don't you think  
that it's helpful up that the people respect us more? That respect is there I can see it now. But before  you don't talk to a Caucasian and and you could tell whoever you meet immediately you can tell by looking at them whether they despise you or they like you they can it can be either one of two they like  you or they don't like you in cases where I know that I have to associate the guy I tried to educate the  person say that was before but now look, you don't have to, they respect you. In fact, the common acid  come over and ask good advice. You know that see Good example is up at Island Park. A lot of them  are from Pocatello why we're around, we'll respect it up there. They look forward to being, going to our  parties that we gave, you know, and have a lot of fun. They're just like, I'm just like, one of them or  they're like us, see no difference. So I guess you'd know yourself that times have really changed. 
Did you ever think it would get to that point? Did you ever think you would get to that point?  
Oh, no. That time I was bitter. In fact, I didn't even like the white race anymore. Because of the way  they treated us so badly. Especially when war broke out when all our white friends deserted us. Treated  us like dirt.  
Did they believe the propaganda? 
They believed that members, you could never trust a jap that was on TV, that they were treacherous. Even though, even though they knew you for a long time?  
Yeah, that's right. For years and years in the believing that, that for disillusion me. So from then on, I  didn't want to cultivate any of the Caucasians. 

16:16 
And my story would be a lot different.  

16:20 
Yes. Well, she was well accepted.  
Well, I was accepted, 

16:23 
you know, because I lived in the community all my life more or less in Idaho. And when I was in high  school, I was in Girls Council, Honor Society and all this stuff, and what's office officers and different  clubs. And I think the females don't have that. Discrimination that the men do for some reason, I don't  know whether you feel that way or not. But being I was in the dancing, I performed for the high school  assemblies and things like that.  

17:07 
Tell us about the whole history because we don't have it on tape that, you know, from the very beginning. 

17:13 
Well, where's the beginning?
Where you born? 
Oh, well, I was born in Buhl, Idaho, which is a tiny, tiny, little community, in my little tiny, my folks, had a  restaurant there. And then from there, they moved to Shoshone and eventually moved to Blackfoot.  And we had a restaurant there. Then, later on, during the Depression. They had to give it up because of  the business, you know. And they kept going in debt. So they finally gave that up. And then we moved  to Pocatello. And my father worked full, he worked at the Carlson building, then he worked at the  Shanghai cafe and so on so forth. And course I, at that time, I was just going to school, and so on. And 

18:07 
when did your parents come here, to this area? 

18:12 
My parents, they were my father came over from Japan when he was just a young fellow about 16  years old. And he never ever did go back. My mother came as a picture bride. So they, I don't know  whether you're familiar with that. But, you know, pictures were sent back and forth. But usually the fan  
About when was that? 
About 1918. And usually the families back in Japan knew each other, or they because they would say  now, if your son would marry my daughter, you know, so on and so forth. You know. So that's how  come the pictures would start going back and forth. And they would correspond. So my mother came  over that way. And she got off in Seattle. And at that time, my father was working on the railroad, like  many Japanese people were. And shortly after that he got a job working in the governor's home at that,  and I don't remember or have never been told maybe exactly what he was doing there. But he was  ended up being one of the cooks. So then he learned how to cook and started at restaurants. 

19:38 
Well, I know that one of the major historical aspects of Asians and particularly Japanese in Idaho, was  with the railroad. So how much do you know about your father's involvement with the railroad? 

19:54 
I don't know very much. 

19:56 
Do you know about how long he worked? 

19:59 
No, I have no idea 

20:03 
okay
