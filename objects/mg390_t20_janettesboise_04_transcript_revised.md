Probably proportion. 

00:07 
I guess what I'm saying that generally, I mean, you know, if there's more, I'm sure that there are  American families who support the children, but as each and every family, Filipina family who is in  Boise, if they will kick out their son when he turns 18. And that's none of them. I mean, to me, that's  significant. I don't think after that. 

00:38 
Just on the spur of the moment, I wouldn't, I wouldn't agree, but I don't think I have any basis on which  to say one or the other. 

00:50 
I have seen families who have American families who have resources. And yet, they, and I'm sure that  maybe it's, you know, it's it builds the character for the son to work as dishwasher, and to support  himself to college. But I have seen how hard it is for college kids to struggle, and maintain a job and  pay an apartment and, and maintain a good grade. And yet, it would, it would have been just not not  even a diss. Well, you know, when the family have the money to support 

01:27 
that's more of the product of an industrial society.  
Stages of development. And I think, 

01:39 
Well, I think all culture will go through that stage, as they get, you know, industrialized, developed. I'm  not saying it's the best, but 

01:52 
I think a student here who wants to go to college, is highly motivated, would have a better chance of  going to college and finishing college than the one who's in the Philippines, who wants to go to college  and doesn't have the resources to go to college, even though he's highly motivated. I mean, the  chances are, he won't go and finish college, you know, just the fact of the financial situation. 

02:19
It's a little bit 

02:27 
people have been coming under pressure. In Texas, for example, you know, the fishermen down there.  And the government is thinking about putting restrictions on immigration, as 

02:43 
well.  
My personal opinion on that one is, I think, usually will be one who is first usually try to close the door  after he is in. I think it's very true with any of those grow from Europe. I have heard some people who  just came from the eastern part of Europe say that right now, those who came from Czechoslovakia,  Hungary. And they seems to be agreeing on top that it's more or less like 

03:22 
As soon as I get here, there's enough, 

03:24 
more or less than something like that. I remember the criticism that some of them has been saying  when Senator Kennedy was creating the bill favoring those English speaking, speaking groups. And I  think one of the groups who were really bothered by that is the Asian community because of the fact  that the Asian community when they when there is a relative who came here, there is a high probability  that some of the relatives will be petitioned to come here, because of the close family family ties that I  never did realize before till I wind up down here. Some of it is in in your mind, you get you might not  know it, you might you might not think about it, but once you're out, some of it will come out. 

04:14 
Anybody else who was wondering, you know, I, they are refugees from Nicaragua and South America.  shop closed door? 

04:30 
I have an opinion about that. I'm not really sure if the country will do that. Because as long as the  country realizes that we need immigrants to help us in our industries, our labor supply, I don't think it  will happen. But when that happens, though, then we probably have some people in Washington who  don't realize the significance of keeping our industry smoothly or keeping our society far develop or far  more I developed in other countries like Japan, or Europe. 

05:09 
They were saying something about how bearish the Asian in terms of supporting the children getting an  education, I remember hearing a lot of things about the negative impact of that, that sometimes the  Asian are being closed out in terms of being able to enter in some school. And sometimes grade  doesn't matter anymore. And it looks like they are assigning a quarter and sometimes the positive  impact that they were saying about Asian students that being well motivated in terms of having an  education, I think, to a certain degree has a backless. I remember in Berkeley and a lot of universities in 
California that there is a four point average Asian student is was being closer because of that. Well,  they see the mother gotta but it's an imaginary things that that seems to be forbidding them to be able  to pursue whatever they want in terms of education. 

06:07 
The Asian children who are getting the high rates are keeping out the average white Americans. So the  educational opportunities, because monopod, monopolizing the high grades, 

06:21 
Every every Asian kids dream is to go to Stanford, or Yale, or wherever. And so if they will accept every  4.0, then Asia, then they will never completely Asian population, which is not good for them to 

06:41 
learn about that, that they did that to the Jews before. It seems like it's a reputation of a certain cycle,  that probably they had never learned that in terms of history that probably those kinds of policies don't  really benefit from that. So 

07:03 
I'm not an immigrant. But I think the issue of of immigration is a very key one. And I think there may be  some merit to putting some type of a limit on the number of immigrants that this country allows, I  realized that a great part of our strength is our diversity. And yet, I think there are certain limits to the  numbers of people, the space, everything else that we have. And at some point, we have to face that. If  not now, not in the year 2000, some time 

07:51 
Do you have any specific ideas how that quota or restriction should be? 

07:58 
No, I'm not studied enough in that area to do want to put something forward. And I know that any of the  ideas that I've heard, certainly have had strong negative sides. But it seems strange. I just can't  imagine us accepting unlimited numbers of people indefinitely, and still being able to provide the same  standard, standard, not just living. But life that we grow 

08:43 
accustomed. You know, one thing about the population is statistics in the United States, he said that,  such that the geriatric stage is already bigger percent of the total population. And when you reach a  certain what they call reproductive age, there is a need for replenishment, especially with the population  in this country. They call it set of growth right now. And then the that's one of the scales that they had in  terms of this social security. Money that they will be getting later on that they say that pretty soon in the  next 10 or 15 years, there will be less, who will be paying to the Social Security and a lot more guests  again. And one way I think that they can only do that to have the cycle of replenishment seems that in  terms of birth rate, and a lot of things, I think they are looking at it in a different ways only through  migration. And migration, I think has a very positive impact, especially in this year of enormous  competitions. One thing I have learned, at least from most of the immigrants that I had talked to,
whether they came from Eastern Europe or Southeast Asia or in the Middle East, they had one driving  force. And then because they don't know a lot of people don't have what they want is to be able to  stand up by themselves. And that one quality, I think you can get that. To most of those people who  haven't experienced what they have experience. So there's a positive side to it. To me (unintelligible),  that if the statistics that they were saying were true, that reality is right there right now, we had more old  person and less in terms of birth rate that we have to think about that cycle of replacing the kind of  services they're providing, whether it's professional or just the service oriented needs. 

10:48 
Let me ask one last question, and we'll end on a positive note. 

11:01 
Right, oh, and what can I do for you? 

11:17 
I think what my side, what I can say is, the barrier area where I can make a contribution isn't the place  where I'm working right now, since I'm working with the state, I'll try to do the best on my part down  there to look at the positive product that I can contribute. Probably that's the best place you can start  with, in addition to the community. 

11:41 
Yeah, that's one area. And then another area, too, is providing, you know, just being very present, I  think in the community provides a lot of good role model for your other Filipino American kids, you  know, to them that they know, you know, look at him or look at her, you know, she's one of my kind,  and she can do it, or she can do it. And I think that's a very, that would be one contribution that one can  do. 

12:06 
And in what ways can I help me so that it's in this case, the Filipinos are being encouraged or  stimulated last month, or? 

12:25 
I don't know I, you know, I 

12:27 
say an education as far as application of opportunities, right. 

12:33 
I think a lot. I think a lot, just the fact that you're a minority right now. And you're you're and you're very highly motivated. I think there's a lot of reinforcements out there to do what you want to do. 

12:45 
We feel that the state of Idaho was really opening up. I think so to

12:55 
say thank you. Thank you. This is your life.
