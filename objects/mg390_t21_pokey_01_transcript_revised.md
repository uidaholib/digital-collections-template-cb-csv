Oh, did you? 
So we went after albacore during the summer.
We did too.  
Yeah, I actually got my skippers license. Oh, they because you have to have to license skippers when  you take out public.

Okay, okay. You guys could clearly hear what's going to happen. He says get closer you just keep  chatting like we are now. Yeah.  
Calm and collected.  
For one thing, why don't you just tell us a little bit about your past. Tell us about your utilize.  

02:15 
Well, Richard, you want to start? The I know, but I can't just ended with myself. I gotta have questions.  Wow. Well, 

02:24 
I understand that your family first settled in Hawaii, do you want you to talk about that. And then yeah,  one of the events leading up to coming to Idaho. 

02:32 
Should I give my uh, you know, my history from the time they first come up in the 1800s. 

02:38 
You're the one that knows more about you read on it. 

02:42 
And now I guess at the Bishop Museum in Hawaii, they've got our picture one of the first settlers. 

02:50 
here know that they had actually written written a book during their centennial celebrations and you  know, indicated that the Yamada family and the Somata families were the first two to come actually  over on contract to work the plantations in Hawaii. 

03:09 
How long was your family there? 

03:14 
Well, my folks born there and I guess they stayed in Hawaii for about oh, I'd say gosh, I was eleven  when I left so at that level, my team dad was 22 So So 22, 32, 33, 33 years in Hawaii. But then the  original area they were in the island of kawaii they came over to raise rice go they had the they didn't have rice in Hawaii at the time they emigrated or their workers out in the cane fields. So he came  grandpa and grandma come over and they got to make region raise rice. That's the beginning of it. Of  course later on the migrate to the island Oahu, Honolulu. 

04:17 
That's about it. His father was quite talented. He used to sing for different programs, weddings, and this  and that. And he had a wonderful voice. And he also played the saxophone. You know, I showed you  that he had more than that. And he played what else the guitar and guitar,  
In fact, jazz band playing the 

04:43 
old time music, you know, same as in the 20s. 

04:47 
And he used to have dances at play for dances and everybody would congregate at his place and  they'd have a dance like Saturday nights or whatever. So he was one of the first to do this, you know in  the Japanese. 

05:02 
And when did they come over to the mainland? 

05:04 
23. That was in 1923. And that was due to the that land law or lease-law that they had in California at  that time they had that what they call the papers that come out about the yellow peril. Have you heard  read about that? So they made it illegal for aliens to rent, lease land. Do you know about that too? Well,  I had an uncle in Lomita, California. And he wrote to my dad and says, you'd like to have him come  over and lease land since he was a citizen. And that's the reason why he came over just to get around  that law. So you see why or we were in on the main mainland. 

05:54 
His father was a postman too. 

05:58 
Mailman, mailman. And they take them to win a cup. Well, I wouldn't know too much about my mother  made him quit. Quit being a policeman says it was dangerous. So he became a postman. Mailman. 

06:20 
And this is when he was living in Lomita. No, 

06:23 
that was in Hawaii. Oh. So what when we came over to California, my dad just made a living leasing  land. He has some like 1000 acres under his name. So actually if that my dad was crooked, he could  have not embezzled, take all the profit and keep it because legally all that farming was under farming 
was under his name. But he was such an honest person. That's why he died a poor person. Too  honest.  
Any other Japanese come over and do that too? Right. Did otherâ€¦ 
Not very many. That is Japanese male that was as old as he was. He was the oldest one of the oldest  one that was a natural born citizen. See? So that's why he had the well, most land that was leased  under his name. They're charging. He was charging them $5 an acre per year. If you had 1000 acres,  which he had, that's 5000 a year. But a nickel was a nickel station. 10 cents, bought a pack of  cigarettes and 25 cents would have bought T bone steak in a restaurant. So you can see that 5000 He  did a lot with that set my brother to college, incidentally, became medical doctor. 

07:57 
And tell us about all of your siblings, your brothers and sisters. Talk about who your brothers and your  sisters. 

08:03 
Well, the family originally had five girls and two boys. That's including me. And they're all settled. And  well, most of them came back from after the war back to out to Los Angeles. I was gonna go back to  with her. But I just didn't like what I what I saw too many people. I'm kind of a loner. The best part of my  life was out on the Merchant Marine and, and being a radio man, you know, so I had to communicate  with the landlines to get the information. See I was on a freighter. Later on, I was on the transport  during the war. But then due to that, I couldn't I didn't like to be around a lot of people. So we're not  when I went back to Los Angeles, I saw so much people around. I just got nervous. And I said no, this  is not for me. I came back. 

09:01 
I understand that there's an interesting story about when you were in the Merchant Marines, and then  you came back to shore and then sent demands and our initial. 

09:11 
You don't want me to tell you my incident and you want to hear the unpleasant part of it? 

09:19 
This is really this is part of what brought you here. I understand, eventually. 

09:23 
Oh, yeah. Well, what actually happened was this. When Pearl Harbor was struck, was that morning that  night, we left at midnight out of Pearl Harbor. See that would be on that Sunday. See? And we're just  outside of Hawaii when Pearl Harbor was struck. Well, I guess the way the merchant marine operated,  they only had one radio man to keep track of the well, for information on where to go, you know,  destination and they do that for eight hours per day. Didn't matter when I didn't have to keep eight  hours. Watch, just just so in 24 hours, I put in eight hours. Well, that morning I got up and put the  earphones on and nothing but SOS is around. See, they were the Japanese were shaking merchant 
now. Well ships left and right around us and we had loads of chromite from the Philippines and you  know how heavy they are, they're heavier than lead. And we won't have a free border, say about three  feet. And one little torpedo, what a sad cuz it would have gone down like, you know, like a piece of  lead. Well, when then the Navy would come in and says to shut up, don't say anything, there's a  moment you hit that key. They can use their direction finders, them find your position. And they'd sent a  bunch of ciphers. And I'd copied and give the skipper record see that he just share a heading or San  Diego or San Francisco, we headed east. And I knew we're going to Mexico I didn't have been I knew  how to navigate to like me, I had a skippers license to hold on hold on suitable. And by doing that, it  took us about 15 days to get back from Hawaii. But we finally ended up in San Pedro see our home  port which was in San Francisco. Well, we got in okay. But then you know who's waiting for me? Guess who? The FBI. Now about a dozen them. They come  up and they grabbed me and says now don't you get away you're gonna get off this ship. We don't trust  you. And the skipper was these folks from the old country are from Norway. And he came up and he  said What do you mean, he's, you're gonna take him up be Japanese, but he's more loyal than I am.  He says I'm from the old. I mean, my folks are from the old countries. And besides, you're breaking the  law. If you've taken him off, he signed on to get off at San Francisco, which is the homeport. You think  that led me off big hustle me off my off the boat, wouldn't let me get my stuff. And that was it. And none  of that led to you know what happened after that? Oh, I tell you something else. It wasn't very wasn't  very long after that, that me and two other fellows figured well, just to show my loyalty list, join the let's  try to get in the Navy as a kamikaze. So we went to the recruiting, recruiting office and we got what  we'd like to do to show our loyalty. You know what they did? They said, they laughed this is what I  mean, trust you guys, you probably turn right around and and hit the battleship, you know. And boy that  really made me decide to help with it. There's no chance of ever getting treated right? Even if your arms  aren't say to see. And that didn't matter. It was my face and being Japanese. Any more questions?  

13:18 
Well, so what happened in terms of the events leading up to you eventually settling in this area? 

13:24 
Well, we were in Terminal Island. At that time, they gave us 24, 24 hours notice to get out of there. You  know, we had a lot of stuff. And 24 hours wasn't enough time we had no trucks. And you know, then the  voters came around when they would they had that ultimatum. And they come over and knock on the  door. You open the door and stick their foot in there. They want to buy our stuff, five cents on the dollar.  We didn't sell it on you know what we did? We gave it to the poor Mexicans. It burns up so much. We  got our alright with hardly anything. In fact, we had to rent a place that was furnished. Couldn't haul  anything. Our battery card wouldn't. Nobody would lend us trucks or anything. Incidentally, we had  friends who were running superstition. But did you know that all the Caucasians deserted us? One day I  knew for years, well the propaganda was that the Japanese were treacherous. You cannot trust them.  They all believed that. See. So after that, that incident they gave us the wish cricket. We couldn't even  leave Los Angeles. Did you know that? They restricted us to the places place we lived. And they just  wouldn't let us go anywhere. Then they had that order to go to Manzanar because that was the first one. Well, I thought that's what  we'll end up with. But then they advertise it says that the pay union leaves (unintelligible) because, like  me, I'm pretty versatile I can do most anything. So I volunteered using and we got that union wages no  15 cents an hour or the 15 cents an hour or down to half per day something like that. And that's how I  ended up in Manzanar. And then I stayed there for about six months. By that time I was going crazy  doing nothing you know, I got onto a job as a timekeeper but then they call then they had a bulletin  saying that to be a loyal Americans and volunteer for to a Montana to top beets. I don't know Montana.  Incidentally, I was I agreed to go on I went to Montana This is to be loyal to the country. Well, I figured  well, this will earn something anyway. So went to Montana the place where a Great Falls, wasn't and  when I got there, me and Ron maybe about 400 others that had gone but see I I'd like to read I always  like to read a lot. First thing I did was buy a newspaper headline watch these, these jabs are gonna  poison the water system. You know what we did?  

We want to go back to hell with this thing. They tell us to be loyal come over and top beets and all that.  And of course, I never knew it was that hard because I'd gone home right away which frankly, we don't  want to work here. They don't trust us, they think we're enemy aliens. And love of people thought we  were shooting in other words they had they never conditioned the people about us that we're going to  go up there and top beets said we were American to them and those things were said. I guess they  didn't want to say that because that'll turn the sympathy you know, towards us. So we went there and  top beets for a while. The first day we taught beat we had a truckload of weed load trucks, you know  how you know how they do they use the old fashioned way, come back with half a truckload of love dirt.  And we knew that the farmer there was playing a dirty trick. And I think what we were spending for food  wouldn't even borrow food for the day. So we stuck again, saying this is not right.  
And that the farmer promises that if we say that he said that there wouldn't be as much dirt load. That  was bald, because we'd hit that and tore it up, see. And the next day well, when we about two days  later, that is it was beet without well, some dirt but the percentage was about five or 10%, which wasn't  bad. Well, after we got through tough and beets, there were issues we were supposed to go to another  place that was that basically, Haarlem, Montana, close to the border, Canadian border. Top beets there  for a while the owner was decent enough to treat us right. But we were put in a chicken coop wrapping  stuff on the floor. And we stayed there and we top beets got through. We're going through from there  we oh, we had nothing else to do. So they sent us to a place called Shelby, Montana. And they put us  in jail. All of us. And oh, there must have been about 100 or so.  
We all got through with Well, that was a holding pen letter I call it, see? Then they had to send a train  up to catch it to send us back to camp. And my plans were not to go to camp I told the guys that I went  with four or five pillars that I started out as a crew. I'm not going to go all the way I'm going to slow  down and jump off I want to have just a little duffel bag you know everything knows was confiscated so  we went through Blackfoot. I woke my friends up and I says I'm gonna get off here and say well that's  your funeral no you don't know what's gonna happen I don't give a damn what happens I'm getting off I  got off and I no job or anything. But I read the paper and says Help Wanted as a mechanic or tune up  man. Being a radio man I knew electronics enough to you know lie about thatâ€¦ Guy told the formula  not for him but guy were hidden mechanic there. I said I can do tuneup work, how much experience I  say well, I can do a lot of electrical work too, which was true but nothing on automotive. So he said well, you show up Monday and says Ah How about I borrow some of your service manuals, I could read it. I  read read it from cover to cover. And I knew what the theory was now that you know, your ignition coils  and all that. Learn how to do it. I mean, came Monday I had to start working. And I did. They were  impressed.  
I even ended up overhauling our speedometers you know, set them back calibrated. And what would  then happen the, while I was there, they set the officials up like a border or War Relocation Authority,  they wanted me to promise that I'd stay there they insisted that I go back, I said a no Over my dead  body as long as I'm an American, take it away then you might be able to do whatever you want, but I'm  an American. So the simple you stay here they don't move and report all the time. Telling us for your at  see, in Blackfoot. Well after a while the pay was so little I didn't want to breathe and wouldn't give it to  me. So I went to Pocatello look for job and found a job here. And then be (unintelligible)I call it w era.  They came after me again. So how come you got out of there? And I said, Well, I can't make a living  and blackbutt places too small. Then the old same old thing got changed. Okay.
