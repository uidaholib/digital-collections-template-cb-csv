You get a break every 20 minutes 

00:22 
okay, well why don't you start off by just telling us a little bit about your background 

00:30 
or background Well, I was born here in Pocatello. 1950 been here all my life 

00:50 
I've never lived left this area except for short trips 

00:58 
and my life has been quite tranquil and placid here I think I have many friends I don't think I have 

01:11 
any enemies that I know of and get along pretty good with the general public can't I farmed? My father  was killed when I was 15 years old and I had to quit school it's okay, it's okay. When you whisper and it  sounds like having to ask it was alright to speak up. Yeah. Oh, is that okay? How did your father's 

01:53 
my father was killed when auto accident run over by a truck. He was had been helping a neighbor put  out a fire using his trip to assist him because it was a burning haystack and he used to help tear down  the haystack and saw he was having his truck pulled back to Pocatello this place where he farmed at  
the time was approximately 10 miles north of Pocatello but he was riding in the truck that was doing the  pulling with fella that worked for him and he was going to get off the truck at a place called Tai Chi  which was about five miles north of Pocatello to talk to my wife's father and he asked him not to stop he  would just jump off and some or the other he fell in front of the rear wheels and he was practically killed  instantly. The time I was 15 years old my father really had a truck garden at that time here in Pocatello.  And since I had gone with him quite a bit I knew most of his customers and knew pretty much how he  did his business so I quit school and continued the business with my mother and my younger brothers  and sisters however they went on to school Jaya after we continued truck gardening or vegetable  farming until World War Two started and at that time, man took so much hand labor which became  scarce that I went into general farming and continued 

04:30
until about 19 or in early 50s. I started to work on various jobs part time while I was cutting my farming  operations down because we were the the city was growing out to where we were living and ground. It  was getting so crowded that there wasn't too much ground available. So after about 1955 or six, I quit  
my farming operation altogether. And since that time I have mostly been working in construction  maintenance or our supervising that phase of it. And I retired about I guess eight years ago, but after  about a year I kind of got back into it again. So I'm on the face of retiring again, this present time. 

06:09 
Do you know why your parents came to America in the first place? 

06:13 
My father came to America in right after the San Francisco earthquake which was above which was 96.  But he came over more or less to make his fortune as I think the general people the man especially did  at that time, our few of them came over I guess to for more or less on educational or learn something  about this country but my father came over with the intentions of establishing enough. Well, I don't think  he ever did expect to establish a business I think he did want to have acquire a little wealth and  probably go back to Japan but after he had been here several years why? I guess he liked it. And  decided against going back so he sent from my mother and she came in 1914. 

07:43 
She has been here ever since except for a couple of visits she made back to Japan. 

07:50 
You'll listen how many children? She what year the oldest of how many?

08:43 
What were the early days like here in Pocatello recall what the community was like at that time. 

08:54 
Course I think we have about twice as many people today as we did back in 1920s 25. I can't  remember much farther back than about 1925. But I know the area of that town has grown or must be  three times bigger than it was in those days. I think my father had loved friends and I think through that

09:36
our family fare well. socially accepted. He had many people that came to see a call on Him have  Caucasian people and so we were fairly well known. I think and from I think from that we fared fairly  well during World War Two period, 

10:24 
so you didn't feel the prejudice that was going on? 

10:27 
Very little. I think there there was some sense wasn't directing directed directly to us but I did hear of  some I think generally general director generate towards Japanese people. Excuse me to kind of stop  this clock Sure. Just depends a 

11:09 
little bit on the board 

11:18 
How do you feel your family has influenced this community and how has this community influenced your family? 

11:31

And we tell everytime we have an opportunity we don't  necessarily boast about it but we like to tell him good points and which I truly believe there are is a lot of  fine points in old oriental culture.

15:41 
Well, I kinda would think about half and half. How so? Well, because we had Oh, I think 50% of our  meals were American style meals. Then friends, there was a lot of Japanese spoken at home. 

16:18 
Do you speak Japanese? 

16:21 
I can understand it. And I can speak. But I wouldn't say all those long ways from I would say a long way  from fluid anymore. I used they used to have what they call Japanese language summer schools here  before World War Two. And most of us attended those and 

16:51 
we were taught the basics, how to read and write. But through not using it, I have lost all of mine. Now, 

17:09 
my sisters that live out of town they write to my mother so they've retained theirs. But I'm sorry to say  that I've lost every bit of mine. And we don't have too much of an opportunity to use the language  except we have to speak it when we're with my mother, but that's the only time
