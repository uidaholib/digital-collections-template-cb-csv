It's surprising how different they are they they some of them have minor characteristics visible  characters are Japanese but they're kind of a group all erase all their own and I know I have the  grandchildren who are mixed marriages my they're just good looking, beautiful children and it seems  like but they do they do well and everything else.  

01:30 
This whole class now, of Vietnamese American children from 20 years ago who are now here for 

01:41 
Progress on are one of those cosmetic companies has one, has an admiration child. It's like the the  woman of the 90s. Yeah. 

01:51 
Oh, I see. 

01:53 
Tell us a little bit about your involvement with the Japanese community. 

02:02 
I think we've been involved in JCL ever since it first started in Pocatello.  
When was it first founded here? 

02:13 
1939. George's, my brother in law was the first chairman and I was, took the next term after him and  both of us have been in and out of there, for time since that time but gosh. 

02:43 
Everyone belonged to JCL, you know whenever they had a convention or anything it there wasn't just a  select group that went. We all went in so our conventions were large and and number and and just fun  to be at. They have changed now because I think as we've our children have grown they have found  themselves going into different organizations becoming involved in their own so many different  organizations anymore you know, that but they aren't so much for JCL. You know, what you find that  around here? It's just the old standbys, the ones that grew up in a in our still plugging away at it. 

03:29 
So that's interesting in terms of how you really haven't noticed that much of a change in the general  Pocatello community. But within the Japanese community, you've noticed the change. 

03:42 
Yes. I don't know just how, there are a lot of people, Caucasian people, and I know that like Paul  worked when he had his vegetable farm and delivering, you know, all the vegetables to different stores.  And that he was more involved with the Caucasian families than I ever was. And I I think there were a  lot of Caucasian people who used to come to their farm to buy these different groceries and our  vegetables and things. And man, they still speak of it, how much fun they used to have and all but  these are as we say, all older people. Since then, since the supermarkets and that have command and  everyone goes and of course (unintelligible) and don't sell vegetables in that fashion anymore. The, m  involvement as far as just neighbors and that was concerned. We lived in the country and there were  never neighbors that close. Went to school and we had friends but we were still in the minority, but just  a part of them because it seems like grade school and online. You don't notice so much. Same way  through high school, I guess. We were never segregated or discriminated to the point of where I think  we were hurt, you know, in any time. And I guess so we just never thought that it was serious enough. I  know there were a lot of minor things that happened during the wartime. I've heard my sister talk about  a neighbor who she thought they were just neighbors who really understood them and would stand by  them thick or thin. But when the war came along, said they were, they were different for a few years  back. I think after the war, why things came back to normal again. 

05:48 
Is your involvement with the Minidoka camp project related to the JCL? Or,

05:54 
Yes, the Minidoka project started, oh, Mossy, who is another longtime member of our chapter, became  involved. By thinking when he had gone out Minidoka several times he said that air one time where all  these 10 1000s of people, and after they left, everything was just forgotten, and bought. Well, now, that  
isn't the right way, you know, to let things go after there have been all these people have been moved  to Minidoka and placed there against their will. And so we started on this project. And there is also, a  now the remains of the guard house and a what was the other building. There two remains, partial  remains, I should say. And so we took that as the kind of a starting place. And we've built a monument  around it and through the ethnic heritage committee, who gave us the grant of $5,000. And then  searching through our own the members who were, at one time interned in camp, we thought perhaps  that would be the best way to go. Since so many of them were from the northwest Seattle area, we tried  to contact them also. All the JCL chapters throughout the country. And the response hasn't been as  good as we had hoped. We had hoped of getting 1000s of dollars so that we can really put up huge  bronze monument and all. But that hasn't matured. So were, we plugged away and getting them what  we could. And I think that through the day sale members there have been over $5,000 donated and  through the ethnic heritage, the other and I we are not expecting about well, possibly not monetarily,  but the Idaho farmer company is going to come through and pave around the the ground out there. The  designated area for Minidoka. And so, but the monument part has been completed, we can use that  just a couple of weeks ago. And on that we'll have three different plaques. One will give the history of  the internment camp, and then another will be the map showing the ground layout as it was when they  were interned. And then the third will be the names of the people who donated money to make the  monument possible. 

09:04 
What is your responsibilities? 

09:07 
Are you doing everything by committee? 

09:09 
What we're more or less doing by committee. Our, Mossy is headed and he has just (unintelligible)  come over. Yes. And as headed as just worked out relentlessly, because we came to a point where no  money and no enthusiasm and they said we got to get that project finished. And so when I hear  oh,Oshiro, who is now the JCR chairman for this area, made contacts. He's a, works for an insurance  man on claims in that and travels quite a bit. And he met with the ethnic heritage committee up in Coeur  d’Alene and presented it and we were given the grant. So then… So that gave us a nice boost. So we  said, Okay, let's get going again. And through that we've been able to complete the project and we're  hoping now to meet with idol person and Mr. Bowler, Aldrich board to be placed on the calendar for  next year's dedication. 

10:25 
What does it mean to the two of you to be called Japanese Americans?

10:42 
I really haven't been called that. I don't believe. Although I know I am. But I'm, I'm proud of the fact that  I am. 

11:05 
So that's about the only way I can put it is that I'm… 

11:10 
Do you think the Japanese tradition has contributed anything to Idaho? The Japanese Americans who  have lived here? 

11:21 
That's a hard one too. 

11:23 
Oh. I wouldn't think so any more than any other culture or race. 

11:38 
And I think, though, that a lot of our, in some small way, I think our cultures have all had to contribute to  the American way of life. In other words, you know, we're not just not just English, Irish or whatever,  because it's just, it seems like we've lived in the community. And there are a lot of things that we have  helped to do. Whenever there have been projects come up and that, and I'm hoping that in some small  way, you know, we've been able to leave a mark for ourselves after we are done. It may not be much,  but I do think we've, we've made it a little nicer place. I used to think that when I was, you know, when I  was teaching the kids in school, and I hope I'm teaching the children, some things that will help them  become better citizens, better people. The children themselves might not have realized that at the time.  But I've since then have had met, a lot of parents of the children who I had when you know, the years  that I taught, and the parents have mentioned how much they appreciated it when I taught their child  and wished I was back there teaching some of the younger one, things like that. So I'm hoping, you  know, in some small way I've I've helped, 

13:08 
How do you feel your Japanese background has contributed to your style of teaching? 

13:18 
I was a disciplinarian. Very much. So, you know, my mom was I think, when you speak about this,  disciplinarian, my mom was probably the strictest person I've ever met. And so I'm pretty much that  way. I think I go along with a lot of fun and that but there wasn't much monkey business. I just and that  was just my, my own way. And I had to have discipline in the classroom, because I just, that's the only  way I could teach. 

13:51
I think that this community pretty much knows that when one of us Japanese Americans localities, state  something that they can pretty well, bank on that we, we're not just talking idle words, we'll do what we  say we will follow through on it. 

14:26 
I don't know. I would say that that would be 99 and a half percent true with all of us, Japanese  Americans that live in this area. Now, I don't know. I don't think I somehow, maybe I'm prejudiced but I  don't have that feeling about the Japanese Americans over on in these bigger congregated areas. Now  going back to thisMinidoka Memorial thing. We sent letters to all the JCL chapters and all the people  that were former residents there. We have, I think we got less than 1% response rate from those that  we sent letters to. So we've had… 

15:27 
You asking for a specific amount or know anything? 

15:30 
No, anything you know, but there were a few. But if there were 10,000 people there, I know. We didn't  get 100 responses. So we've had to go ahead and figure out a way to raise the finances for that. No. 

15:56 
When, when the people were in Minidoka camp with the assistance, were you aware of it? And what  did you think? 

16:04 
He was. 
Well, that was quite a desolate place. I had some cousins in there. And then that time, I was farming.  So I went over there to talk to several the fellows that eventually came to work for me. But it was a  hellhole . 
How did you feel about it? 
Well, I felt that, I didn't think it was right. Really, because it was they were supposed to be citizens and  to be put into a place like that, you know, I guess I'm more or less thought that they were entitled more  than that if they had to be 

16:58 
put under some kind of security. So I didn't think it was at all fair.  
You said that you went to visit?  
Yes. 
See, we were only people that were moved or just those in Washington and Oregon and California and

17:24 
part of the Canadian border, western part. Those of us in the inner-mountain we were not relocated at  all. 

17:36 
Did you ever worry that maybe they would change their mind and relocate you? 

17:40 
Well, I didn't think about you know if the war had taken a turn for the worse. I didn't think about that. 

17:53 
(unintelligible) couldn't you offer them safe shelter here in Idaho? 

18:01 
We finally, we finally did add the older ones. See they they could voluntarily leave the west coast  before, before that, order came evacuation order was finalized, you know. So I did bring, I had two  cousins. Three, two girls and a boy that came, that lived with with us. The older brothers. They were  see, six of them in the family. The older boys a decided to go on their own. And they went to the this  Minidoka camp for a while but the three younger ones. My mother wanted to take care of them so they  live with us.  

19:10 
And while they were at the Minidoka camp, you couldn't get them out? 

19:16 
I think hundreds of them, didn't they come out to help the evacuees, hundreds of them come out to help  with seasonal work going on different farms and that and that was quite quite a nice thing I guess.  Especially when you speak to a lot of the Caucasian families who lived in, in that Minidoka area. They'll  tell you how much they appreciated the Japanese coming out and helping them harvest their beets and  their potatoes. But they were allowed to evacuate before, I mean to to leave on their own before they  had to evacuate to these, the inland getting off. So I know that we did the same thing, I had an uncle  him and his family living in Los Angeles. And we moved them out. And they stay. They did. They never  had to go to camp at all. And then there were several people in Utah when we were at the time that  were not disabled, many, many families who evacuated on their own. And I remember this one fellow  telling us that he thought that the time of evacuation was one of the best things that happened to him  because he had lived in Mountain View California all of his life. And he said that, had it not been for  evacuations, we probably would never let state and he said I'm learning so much by moving out and  being you know, coming into different in different parts of the state well, different states actually and  and getting to see the land and that and he said he thought that was just a priceless experience that he  had. So I think and I'm sure there were a lot of people who lost a lot of property, well them at everything  because of the evacuation. But there were also on the other hand, some people who didn't have to go  through that sad experience just… I'm sure it was bad enough having to move in on giving up their home and that but those of us in this inner mountain area where we're fortunate and that was because  we didn't have to evacuate
