00:04 
I bid on a job and I didn't get it because of race. See, he doesn't get that anymore. So you can see the improvement 

00:19 
There were certain accounts that were just dogs. They didn't have any reason to hate the Japanese,  but it was passed down from their father and their mother. Yeah, sometimes. 

00:30 
It's the way they were brought up to you know? Did you ever feel any, Mimi?  
People never knew what I was. 
Yeah. Yeah, probably so. 

00:47 
Okay. I guess the first question is, how traditional or non traditional has your family been with respect to  Japanese culture? 

00:57 
As far as your parents bringing you up, did they bring you up as? 

01:05 
No, they brought me up as a traditional American. Of course, our problem was not, we didn't have that  problem learning, speaking Japanese because they spoke English. So I didn't know how to speak  Japanese. When I got out of high school. My folks sent me to Japan to learn it. Took me a year and that  year was a long time for me. I finally learned it now I can understand but I cannot understand Japanese  on TV. They speak another language. See, So 

01:36 
How old were you? How old were you when you went back to Japan? 

01:41 
Right out of high school. 

01:43
Was that a common thing? I've heard of other people doing that, sending their children to Japan. 

01:48 
No, me me. I went because it was my choice. My brother was going to medical school and my dad  asked me what I want to be, I says I don't want to be anything. You want to be a dentist? I said, No, I  don't like to look in people's mouth. And I said about going to Japan. And I was kind of a adventurous  person. Anyway, I like to travel. That's how it happened. I was asked to do the year. But as far as being  here, you know, didn't even give it a thought. We just wanted to be Americans. And treated as such. I  know she’s the same way.  

02:25 
Well my folks, course were immigrants. So they spoke Japanese between themselves and well… And  they spoke some to me. But they wanted me to be sure and get a good education. That was the  primary thing. They felt like if you were here in this country, you had to have good education. So they  pushed me as far as schooling goes. So I always had to get good grades. Because, you know, 

02:57 
So you're pretty Americanized then. 
Yes.  
And do you speak Japanese at all? No. 

03:03 
Well, the only Japanese I speak is from what I learned from my parents, because being immigrants,  you almost learn that way, by listening to them and understanding what they were saying to each other,  and so on. And sometimes they would talk to me. But then my sister and my brother, of course, we  never spoke Japanese to each other, we always spoke English. 

03:31 
And you, how do you feel? Do you feel that you were raised in a traditional Japanese manner in terms  of trying to seek out the Japanese culture, I know that part of your masonry work seems to reflect that. 

03:43 
I think, I think I'm, I've been fortunate to have the best of both worlds. Because when I reflect back, you  know, about the time when my parents were growing up, you're, you're looking at a time of high  discrimination hysteria, when a time of being Japanese was not fashionable. I think that, you know,  we're in a very, very nice time where I've been able to appreciate what happened, and more  importantly, appreciate the past of who we really are. And I think I would recommend that to any race  for them to find their roots and to appreciate that, you know, I think as I, you know, I'm very proud of of  being Japanese because of the centuries of tradition and honor, that, I guess is emulated in day to day  life. And I think that some of the things that the Japanese do today are standards by which others are  matched. And it's not the physical standard that is being said, it's the mental and it's the spiritual  standard. I think when I went to Japan, one of the things that, that really stood out between two great nations, as an example, Japan and Germany that have a lot in common. They're very, very basically  the same in terms of their precision and their pride in what they do, and their scientific approaches. But  Japan had one element that was tremendously different. They had more shrines. And you could see  that visible in day to day living. 
I think that, you know, a lot of the great books that are being written about Japanese businesses today  reflect that life is a struggle. And that, you know, as they've often said, that it's the direct approach by  which you'll enter the battle. But it's the indirect approach by which you'll ultimately win the war. You  know, it's interesting that as the, the Japanese strategist talk in terms of life is as a struggle and as a  battle, and learning to confront each issue. You know, they say, you know, for example, Miyamoto  Musashi, said, you know, learn to parry your opponent's useful actions and allow his useless actions,  there are too many people who try to look good in the public eye. And by the time it comes to  responding to the task at hand, they're already tired, and they've already exhausted their resources.  You know, they talk in terms of, you know, do not learn to, to fight the sword as it comes at you, but  fight the man who wields it, you know, so each of these little tidbits they try to relate to day to day life.  Some of the things that, that have meant a lot to me is that there have been a lot of tragedies in our  lives. There have been a lot of miracles and miracles don't just happen. One of the things, you know, I  see that you never know, when that report card of life comes. And it usually will come at the most  inopportune time, the most unexpected time. And I think that's the part of our tradition that I cherish the  most is the consistency of day to day living, of getting back to the basics and remembering who we are. 

07:02 
How has this community affected you? And how have you affected the community? 

07:13 
Just feels like an American. I feel like what the rest of them feel. And, of course, what I think you know  that others might think differently, cause nobodies are alike. So I don't think there's any problem as far  as the community goes. I feel like there's no difference. Like everybody else. 
Was it hard getting your business started? 
That's right. Well, I've been out of it for about 10 years. So I wouldn’t know what the trend is right now.  But he'd like he can tell you, but I think he'd do a real good look up to there are things to look up to.  Whereas when I was in business, I had to look there, it looked down on me and make me look down by  insulting me. 

08:08 
Why don’t we talk about your business? 

08:10 
When I was in it? 

08:12 
yeah, and how it's been transferred?

08:14 
Well, mainly it was so being a lesser, I mean, a minority in a minority group, I had to do a little bit better  in order to succeed. See, that's been that way throughout my life. If I want to hold down a job, no matter  what, I had to put out a little bit more effort to be a little bit better than anything I do. So came my little  depression, some that hold on to me and get rid of the others. But if I were Eagle, I would have been  the first one to let off. That is a racially because if you're competing with a bunch of Caucasians, you're  you're just mud. Unless you excel in your ability a little bit better. If you're saying your your out, oh,  that's how it was in business two, I'd been if the bids were saying I'd lose every time see. And I know  Huey. I don't think he he'd have that too. But there must be some business even now that,  that'll…discriminate.  
And what business is this?  
This isn’t a store. He's running a store. I was in the contracting business where I bid on a building and  then they compare bids. See, during that time, they didn't have such a law as well… What they call that  Huey, were you when you bid and same and then reveal the amount of… 

09:48 
A peddled bid, huh? A peddled bid or closed, closed bid? 

09:53 
No, it was all open those days. They don't have such a thing as closed bid. They called it peddling. The  peddle is… a well he'd bid $2,000. So your bid is 5, 2500? Will it come down to 11? And how many  1999 and beat him by $1? That's what happens. So I'd lose out and… What hurts is a time that's  involved figuring out the material, labor and all that. So you want to build wrench around 15-20,000 with  building material those days. Then you'd lose out. So one time I was so disgusted, I went to the  company. I guess you know, uh, FMC here, you know, the big factory here? And I demand it as I'd like  to see that bid. Because I know the person I bet against role is high, kind of late, a lot of overheads.  And, you know, they wouldn't show, tell me about it. I lost and I'd like to know why. And to this day, I  just got, you know, think about it once in a while, but I'd never do it again. If it was those days, maybe  now it's over with because you can insist bids be closed. And they don't reveal it till I mean, they don't open your envelope till the time comes. See 

11:22 
How about you tell us about your business.  

11:24 
Jeff, I, I'd like to, if I could, for just a second come back to a previous question. And my answer, in terms  of if I felt I had been raised in an Americanized family or a traditional Japanese family, and I started to  say, and I got sidetracked, that I feel that I've really been raised in the best of both worlds. Because,  again, I think, because of the discriminating times were over, it was acceptable and almost becoming  fashionable at that time to, again, search out your roots and appreciate those. You know, I think in  addition to that, spending so much time with my grandmother, I was able to pick up the Japanese language, because she couldn't speak English. And because of the opportunities that have that  afforded me, just that one little incident, I interpreted for the Japanese delegation at the first  international Boy Scout Jamboree in the United States. Which was quite an honor to me and a privilege  to be able to share again, part of the Japanese American culture of how it had been westernized and  sharing some with the old country. You know, I think the other side of it is, is again, being able to, I  guess, profit from the experience of listening to the feudal times and the life's experiences, and, and my  mother and father have always taught, to encourage, to encourage that learning and that curiosity. And  consequently, I was encouraged through those experiences to search out, you know, some of the, the  finer points of our tradition, of some, of how deep rooted and sacred it really is. So I feel if I were just if I  were given a choice to say traditional or non traditional, I would say very traditional Japanese. And I  think our business, attitudes and techniques, our day to day performance and the consistency of what  we do reflects that, that traditional Japanese approach. 

13:28 
Tell us a little bit about your business and how it's grown through the years. 

13:32 
Again, I think with, with the business, I have to come back to, to crediting that the doors were I guess,  opened as a result of, of our, of my father and my grandfather and our ancestors earning that earning  the right of respectability. And so consequently, it has made it easier on us to, to be accepted and to  succeed. When my father retired, we jointly built the buildings out at Suenaga Masonry supply. And I  remember building those buildings with our own hands. And it wasn't a matter of, of an eight hour day,  it was 17 hours a day, seven days a week. We've been in business 17 years. When I think back of  things in my past that were an inspiration to me, when times would get hard during the construction  phases. I would always remember that when my father said that he built my mother's studio. He didn't  tell you that, that, that has a full basement under that studio, and that he dug that by hand. You know  and so as I reflect back in terms of how hard we perceive that we have it, I always come back as an  inspiration to what our, our parents and our grandparents went through because that's when you  inspiration. What's happened is because of of being accepted because we've earned our right and  society. Suenaga Masonry has been able to go coast to coast, we've been able to do more shopping  centers than any other single distributor in North America right now. 
In 1984, we were awarded the Jimmy Sikes Memorial Award as the number one distributor in the USA,  by a vote of all the domestic and the foreign manufacturers throughout the world. I say that not as a  credit Suenaga Masonry, but because it's the tradition and the people. And the attitude that has driven  that to that level. I think, where the benefits beyond the business side of what Suenaga Masonry is, it  has spun off other organizations and contributions to current society. A second corporation that we're  involved with, which, which we are the owners of is Architectural Hieroglyphics, which is highly artistic.  But beyond the business side, what it has done, it has given us the opportunity to contribute back to our  society and to our friends that have supported us through the years… To I guess, have buried some of  those hatchets, so to speak, and gone forth, as my Father is saying today, he enjoys a healthy  relationship with people of all walks. You know, the, you know, I guess the reason we were brought into community service, for example,  was because of my mother and father's reputation. My mother and father have always been strong  supporters of children, the obvious, you know, that direct approach, so to speak, the obvious is, is  through my mother's teaching has touched so many children's lives. And it's an inspiration to me to see  that gratification come from, from coast to coast, as they grow up, and they call back. And it's always  with very timbre feelings. You know, I feel that each family needs to make a statement and needs to  make a contribution to society wherever they are. And it's not, you know, I guess that contribution is a  relative thing. You don't measure success and how large it is. It's what it means to you and your family.  And I've been able to continue that tradition in helping children and helping elderly people in our  community, because of the education and the, the sense of travel, that learning to deal with people in  our circumstances. It has made, enabled us to assist in some of the more political aspects of our  community, in contributing from the business side, from the economic development base of assisting on  on redirecting the strategic plans of the region. 

18:07 
In what way? 

18:10 
About three years ago, we were selected as, as one of 34 people on an executive strategy commission  to write and document a plan for economic development. We were very, very instrumental. In fact, the  quotations and everything that are in that strategic plan for economic development came from the  influence of this family. And that doesn't happen by me, or my children or my mother or my father,  independent on, one another. It's, it's a collective effort. 

18:43 
You've talked about what it meant to you to be able to draw from the best of both worlds. Essentially,  Japanese American. How about the two of you, how what does it mean to you to be a Japanese  American? 

18:58 
Well, I felt like that we had to work with the community. And so I have had joined soroptimist  International. And, as, as an officer, I felt like we did many projects to help the community. We, with the  Rotary Club, we have donated many things like chairs to the service center to the citizens. For the  senior citizens. We have donated a microwave to the abused children and Women's Center. We have  contributed machines of all sorts to the hospitals. We have done many service projects and outside of  that, with the dancing we have the children have performed at the nursing homes every month each  year and for different weddings and so on. So I think they have had a lot of exposure in their dancing.  And I directed, the Miss Poke tilt pageant for seven years. And I also was Associate Director in Boise  for the Miss Idaho pageant, and I was connected with so therefore I've worked with a lot of teenagers,  and I hope I've helped them. So, and in return, really
