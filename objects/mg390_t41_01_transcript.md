What do you think? 

00:53 
Because he's so big oh 

01:02 
well maybe maybe 

01:10 
maybe this this is the first picture I guess Leonard should not be in the picture. I'm the mother and and  and the two and then the and then he 

01:24

01:26 
wherever they want everybody who's who's who's missing among the children. The

02:03 
Snowball is a dog. 

02:07 
A little noisy one. 

02:11 
You can tell that is a noisy one's heard? 

02:17 
How often do you get together like this? Is a family?

02:20 
Oh, quite often? As a family? Yeah. At least a couple of times a week. When you say yeah, once a  week. Sometimes Mary don't get to join us because she's always working. Mary, Mary is always a  clown. It only works on on weekdays when she teaches you see, but but Mary teach and work in the  Desmos. And and so she has three, four jobs. 

02:56 
What do you do when you get together as family? 

02:58 
Mostly each, we usually get together for dinner and then we chat afterwards. And sometimes we come  back to the house to have dessert 

03:11 
is this something that you've always done is we've said Chinese tradition more. 

03:18
It's it's a Chinese tradition. But mostly because we want to be together. We don't get together very  much during the weekday because we're all busy. So on the weekend is the time when we do have  time together we usually it outdoor outside and then come home and chat for a 

03:45 
while to you know, sometimes we do activities together. For example, if there's something going on in  the theater or the you know, ballets and this type of thing we go as a family, but since you do have this  mixture of generations, you know, mom wasn't into a lot of mom and dad weren't into a lot of the you  know, the tennis and the swimming and camping out and that type of thing. Where you know, some of  the the newer generation, you know that the younger ones of us do. And we traveled together to as a  family. In other words, we all our whole family got together and expo together. And then we also

04:19 
this is including all the other young sisters 

04:22 
and all their family and all their families to as many as they 

04:25 
can. And then we went over to the Oregon Coast one year. And we just kind of did that. After Dad died  as we move in to try and do this as a traditional type of thing. And then it ended up that the third time  we tried it they we couldn't get it all together. And so we're kind of thinking that maybe sometime we got  to do it in Hawaii together as a family again, where we, you know, 

04:49 
we try to have a family reunion once a year, and we try to go to the place that if there's an egg spool or  if there's something else going on someplace else, that's what we'll go we usually get together and go  there. That is, my family and and the rest of the children, grandchildren, 

05:15 
activities to do and where there are, you know, you can get to know each other, you know, some  people will want to go shopping, some people will want to go this way or that way, and yet away from  their homes, so that they don't have those kinds of ties with other friends. You don't. 

05:28 
I can I can picture how big this family is. How big is this family? Marie? 

05:35 
Well, my daughter, Claire has four children. And Mary is a career girl. And Gary's my oldest son. He is  a lawyer in his own office in Nampa. He and his wife Anita has three children, two girls and a boy. The  oldest one is 

06:08 
Jennifer, Jennifer,

06:09 
Heather, and Heather and Daniel. And then the fourth one is my daughter, Cheryl. She lives in  Corvallis, Oregon, and she and her husband. Her husband works for Hewlett Packard and they have  two children. The oldest ones four year old Sariah. And the younger one little boy. Sigh. And then yeah,  and then Dennis has just moved to San Diego about two years ago. He was on he was here he was  working for a travel service. And then when he went down there, he still work for trial service, but he  feels that that that is just not not going to work for him that that so he is selling for a Honeywell  Honeywell operation cooperation in San Diego now. And his wife, 

07:11 
electrical engineer working for the Navy. And then they 

07:15 
they have two children. One is a Tony at 10 years old. He's in the fifth grade is September, and the  youngest one is Devon, he's born five months ago. 

07:33 
Did you Marie, how did you and my come to Moscow or come to Idaho? 

07:39 
Oh, my family, my father and mother and. And children came over here to Moscow. In 1926. We my  father came over when he was younger, about what 19 Nine and Matt. But when he came over, he  could just come over by himself because his father paid for his fare coming over. And that's all he can  afford. And in those times they do not include the wife to come over because the United States people  think that if the wives come over, maybe they have too many children whatever. Well anyway, what is it  the they only a allowed all the younger? They want the the men come over without their wives. But my  mother was pregnant at the time when my dad came over here. So I was six years later, the first time  he went back to China. And when I first saw my father, and when I was six years old. And he when he  came over as a boy he went to school, and then also work to to make a living for himself. And then and  then a night, I think somewhere around 1915 He went back to China and saw my first time I mean when  he went back to China. My my mother and I were there once there and then about a year later by my  sister, Shang Yi was born in 1916. And then after that, where he went to when he was still in China, he  went to Hong Kong to train as the Ubers so he can come back over here to make a living as a doctor.  He came back somewhere around about 1918 Back to Spokane and that's when he first came over his  stay in Spokane and And after he came back, after the training with as an herbalist. He started being a  doctor over here and started his practice in Spokane. About 1920, the winter of 1920. I remember it  was wintertime because the first time I saw Snow was, was one we came up with by boat into Seattle,  the Port of Seattle. And I saw the snow I said, Well, what's what's all this on the ground? You know,  well, they explained to me that snow and that's when I saw that and, and then my father went into  Seattle to bring us back to Spokane. And then the first thing after we got home was, I heard my father  talking next room. I knew there was nobody there, you know, I can understand what he was doing. So I  went around, he was talking on the telephone. That's the first time I knew about the telephone. So  about later on in, I think, the first semester in 1921. I started in grad school at the Hawthorne school in 
Spokane. I finished grad school in 1926. And that was one though we plan to we move over here to  Moscow in 1926. We wonder how come that we went into the restaurant business was they my father  and mother came around? He said, Well, let's go around the police country see what is law like, you  know, so they came over here and went to Moscow and went to a house cafe to get my little sister to  your sister some cookies. before they left the house cafe they bought the cookies and the cafe. So  that's how come we started in Moscow. We have the restaurant starting at July the third. I remember  that because we wanted to have the business. July the fourth. So I remember that. And that's where we  were and until you find that my father and mother's restaurant 

12:11 
was house cafe. 

12:13 
On the corner of second and Main. 

12:16 
How did your father get to have? How much? I mean? How did he get to help that much money to buy a restaurant? 

12:25 
Well, you see, after he came back here 1918 He saved enough money to buy 19 Winter 1922 cent for  my mother and my my sister, Shani and myself to come over here. And then of course, he was a  practicing as a doctor there until 1926 Khitomer Why do they 

12:50 
have to start with just a second? Record? There's a couple of things. One thing 

12:57 
to do it you had my mad Yeah, well, 

12:59 
okay. Then from there, I 

13:03 
you don't want that little story that I told you about why they decided to quit the business or business  and then never gonna go to New York, remember? And they decided they'd see the 

13:13 
loose country before we leave here. Definitely. 

13:19 
Because once we because again, this shows some of the superstitions of the Chinese. Well, the fact  that what you that's the way they feel about right, because you know, he hadn't been able to save his  own sons. Remember, I told you we have decided to give up.

13:35 
Okay, all right. Well, let's tell me, tell me. What made your dad give up the business in Spokane? 

13:45 
Well, in 1923, my sister Cory was born. The first the first one of our family to be born in Spokane. I  mean to be born in the United States. She was born in 1923 in Spokane, and then I think somewhere  around 1925 We have we have a brother David was born there. And within nine months why he died of  Splinter mother's diagnosis. So, my father, by that time, my father don't feel like he's, he's quite the  person to help other people when his own first son died in in 1919 26. So, so that's how come well we  were we were getting all packed up ready to go to New York, maybe go into the restaurant business or  something else. Whatever will be presented to us to do that. But before we leave Spokane, we thought  my dad and mother thought they would like to visit around the police country because we haven't had a  chance to come down this way to the poorest country, when we're so busy in Spokane doing doing my  father's practice, because my mother and I, we have to work behind and get the bottles and the herbs  ready, you know, and cook it and make it into medicine and then why my father is the one that  prescribes the herbs to the different patients. So that's how come we they decided that they would like  to buy house cafe when when they came over here, during that drive around the Palouse? 

15:46 
Can you describe how that early part of the business? 

15:50 
The all the rational investment? Yes, yes. Well, at that time, we we got house cafe because Mr. Huff  had just finished as finished school in the law school, and he wanted to go into law practice. And so it's  a good time for him to get out of the restaurant business. So that's how my father bought it, and also  bought it and then we started, like I say, July 3 1926. 

16:24 
Recollection how much the cafe was? And how much is how much you paid for the coffee? 

16:31 
I'm not sure. But I think it's somewhere around 800 $1,800 for the equipment or whatever was in the  restaurant, and the goodwill of the house, Mr. Nice house, but not the building. No, no, not the building,  we were renting. They were renting the building. And so we kept on being a renter. 

16:53 
So was there any real difference as far as the the business, you know, from when the house had is due  when you as an oriental family had it? 

17:02 
Well, we started the Chinese food here, we've been the only Chinese family here at that time. We  started whatever they were serving, we serve that in the American food and but we add the Chinese  food.

17:25 
clinic eat a lot of Chinese food no right at first and not very much used to it. So gradually, they have to  learn that because most of the customer here are farmers and some students. They have to learn to  like it before. And then I know we had there was quite a bit of prejudice against Chinese people at that  time. And we saw many customers, you know, just walk past our door and went to some pre sales  because we're Chinese people. They just wouldn't come in. 

18:06 
How did how did you feel about that? 

18:08 
We didn't feel very good about it. Because we figured you know, we were serving the American food  just as, as good as the other the other questions are and, and just as inexpensive, maybe a little bit less  expensive. Because we we have to work. We usually work 16 hours instead of the eight hours that the  other residences, employees do. I mean, ourselves are we ourself but what we two system cooks that  we we hire, of course, they would only work for eight hours. 

18:47 
When did you begin to see a change in the way the community responded to your restaurant service? 

18:54 
Well, for one thing, we we belong to Christian Church in Spokane. And so when we came over here, we  we belong to the central Christian Church in Moscow here and that kind of a brick the whatever, you  know, among some of the people but because at least we have the support of the church people and they 

19:22 
were all came to your restaurant to 

19:26 
Yes. Some of them you know, at that time, not very many people eat outside like they do nowadays.  They just on on a special occasion like birthdays and anniversaries. So then they will come to the  restaurant and then some gradually get to learn to like the Chinese food. So that went over quite well. 

19:54 
So how did my come into the picture your husband? 

19:58 
Oh, my husband was like Going to school at Washington State College at that time, he graduated in  1929, as a silver engineer, and he thought, well, he got great ideas of going back to China to help the  Chinese people out and building buildings and bridges and roads. But so he, he went back in 1929,  after after he graduated and looking to see how things are in Canton. At that time, his folks were living  in Cape Town control nowadays, is what the name of it is now. But he can see that he can just kind of
feel that there's going to be war coming on. And another thing is, the Chinese government is very  corrupt at that time. And when they hires civil servants, you have to, they give them the understanding  that they have to entertain their hire their bosses, as well, by the time I, I would entertain half of my  wages to be gone, and they wouldn't be very much left over for myself. So he came back over here in  1931. But before he left here, why we have we have gone together, and we like each other. But I told  my I told him, I said, Well, I'm gonna let you have the chance to look over all the Chinese girls in China.  And if you come back here and marry me, don't ever don't ever complain to me that you couldn't find a  finding by us to marry as millions of Chinese girls, you have a good choice. But I guess he felt that he don't want to say in China, he came back here in 1931. So he came back about me. And then there  was nothing that he wanted, he can go into it that time not in 1931, we were having a big, big diversion  here. And of course, the civil engineer there about about a dime a dozen at that time. So he didn't get  any job in that. So he started working for my father then for a couple of months. And we decided to get  married July in July of 1931. And about that time, my father feel like that he wanted to take the younger  children. At that time. My sister core, and my and my, my brother, Robert, and Sammy. He took them  back there because he wants them to have a little bit of Chinese culture. Besides what American  culture that they have acquired since they were born here. I mean, since my, my sister and brothers  were born here, 

22:58 
during the early part during the early part of your marriage, how many Chinese family other other  Chinese families were there in Moscow? 

23:08 
I don't remember but I think there were one or two. No, I don't 

23:15 
think it was somebody in the laundry down here. 

23:19 
No, that was before our time. In the old days before we move in the 80s. I mean, in the 1800s. They  used to have people down there on on Jackson Street. I have the laundry. I think the excavations have  shown that they have Chinese people there but we didn't never knew them. We were the first family  that Chinese family that was over here. As far as I know. At that time I imagined. I don't think there  were any other families here. But there are some Chinese students going over here. They come directly  from Hong Kong, Mainland China or Taiwan. 

23:59 
So how you were the only Chinese family? Yes. For your social entertainment. That's right. Where do  you did you interact with the rest of the community? Or how did you 

24:11 
start not too much? Mostly, at first we the only people that we knew as friends are the church people at  the central Christian church people and gradually Of course we get as far as socializing is concerned  we didn't have any time to socialize with our a you have to do is work in the restaurant and if we can, if we have more business we were hard. More help but right at first I just just my and I have a we're  working the restaurant. I think we have one waitress about 1931 It was very bad business all over it  was bad. 

24:55 
I have a question. If you don't mind my asking. What would you say was the most A unique experience  that happened to you here that you could attribute to being Chinese as opposed to just being a resident  of Moscow. 

25:09 
You're talking about when she was growing up growing up. 

25:13 
I was I was 16 years old when I came over. And when we moved here in 1936, I started high school  here in 1926, and then went on to college. 

25:26 
Did you have any particular experiences? I mean, was there anything that your mind 

25:31 
nothing particular, I have very few friends. Mostly, all girlfriends. Of course, at that time, of course, my,  my father and mother would not let me date anybody. And there was no other Chinese boys around  here. So I just went to school and study and then went to work at the restaurant. 

25:54 
Did you feel it was possibility for you to date? White boys? 

26:00 
Well, I never even thought about dating at that time when I was 16. Chinese people don't start dating  until they are practically through school. I don't think my folks who I knew they would they wouldn't let  me date anybody. What am I actually knew, though? Well, my younger sister is different. She's She she  did date with some men and boys. How old was she? Well, she told me I was I was 16 years old when I  came over. So Oh, at that time when she came over, you know, she was six years younger. And my  sister Shani was six years younger. So when I was 16, she was only 10. Because she didn't start dating  until she was really into high school. My sister Shani, and my sister core. And my brother Bob were all  graduates of Moscow High School and the universe downhill. Except my brother Bob. My, my husband  wanted him to go into pharmacy kind of leading him toward pharmacy since since my sister Corps was  going into medical school. 

27:20 
Very when you when your parents were raising you? Can you could you remember that? They were  raising your differently than you raised your children, you and my? 

27:33
Oh, yes. As far as, as far as I know, I think we're much more modernized. And my parents are because  they had just great school education over here and whatever English they can learn. But on my on my,  my husband, I marry my, with our children, why were more or less, more modern? 

28:03 
What do you mean by more Manuel let him 

28:07 
mix more with American people with their friends, you know, they would have friends, of course in high  in high school and the university. But 

28:18 
at Cornell quality too, though. 

28:19 
Well, 

28:21 
I mean, no, no, 

28:22 
no. In 19 In 1937,

28:27 
she had American friends and so did Uncle Bob in particular. Yes. Anyway, why don't you tell him about  the you know what happened when she was dating the University of Idaho

28:41 
of Athabasca, mine is to eat and not mine. Well, in a way, my sister Shani, who's six years younger.  When she went to the University. She dated American boys. Because at that time, even at that time,  there weren't very many Chinese boys. And didn't French was the dean woman at that time. You know,  she had a good talk with my sisters as well. You mustn't go out with American boys too much, you  know, I mean, but of course, my sister didn't go overboard, but she have her regular friends as well. If  the other students can keep can keep the boyfriend so I hate why can I you know, go out on dates with  them. You know,

29:36 
how did your family react to that? 

29:39 
Well, we didn't like it too much. But then you can do very much about you know 

29:44 
what would infringe would say that
 
29:46 
oh, no, no, no, not that. We didn't like the idea of her going. Dating out too much. 

29:54 
How was it when, when your children were growing up in terms of school go into, like, say dating on  this aspect of dating. 

30:03 
Well, the education comes first. Of course, if they have ever do all the lessons, you know, and still have  time to go out, we let them go out. Well, some with friends with very, very good friends but not just just  anybody you know, every Tom, Dick and Harry. 

30:25 
We wouldn't go out with any just any Tom, Dick and Harry anyway. But I was a junior in high in college,  when I asked for the first time to go to a movie with a friend that was always the guy. And my dad says  that he preferred that I didn't. And so I didn't try. But it was but he just, well, no, he didn't know he  wouldn't forbid, and I wouldn't need the word forbid for me not to do it. And so and so I didn't I didn't  date until after college. 

30:55 
Right. And I didn't date at all in high school or college. You were? Yeah, I never got to go out with any  as Caucasian.

31:07 
That the idea my, my husband feels is that going to school is going to school, and you have no time to  be dating. And so he said, Well, wait till they're at least a junior at college. For 

31:25 
me, Dave as a 

31:26 
junior No, but he didn't like to have you do it. But he did not forbid you to do it. 

31:33 
I was married by the time I was a sophomore. In other words, he let he let us go out as long as it's the  right person, right and the right person had to be 

31:44 
Chinese. Not not that not that we have anything against the American people. It is much better. If you  do marry within your own race, you have a background together the same background the same as the  same hot coals, cultures, and the same ideas that the Chinese people have. 

32:12
How did you I'm curious, how did you Claire and Mary see the family structure in terms of the decision  maker or the final decision maker? Or how in terms of rules on behavior. 

32:26 
While I was more as far as any kind of doing anything, like I said, my dad would not have to forbid me  to do anything for me not to do it. If he says I prefer that you didn't, then automatically. I was that way.  So I never had any problems as far as well. Both of us, you see 

32:44 
are kind of from the quote, same generation. Okay, from there on down. And because you see, Gary, of  course, married out and well, they all have, okay. But for us, I guess, again, you know, you can ask my  kids to, I'm afraid this facet of my growing up of my growing up is still is still a part of me enough that I  feel very strongly about this myself. You're saying 

33:16 
that you were raised by your parents in a traditional Chinese? Yeah, way. 

33:21 
Now, of course, she possibly didn't feel as. But I actually I guess I didn't until I went to Hawaii. We, each  of us when we graduated from high school, went to Hawaii for a summer. Yeah. And of course, we had  been raised, you know, amongst, you know, in Moscow, in essentially an all Caucasian community  atmosphere. And so when I went to Hawaii was the first time I had been immersed into, you know, a  multicultural setting. And I realized when I came back, that my dad was right, and that I would marry  within my, you know, with, at least within the Orientals. And so then Leonard and I started, Leonard  already had was working on his master's. And so we started dating when I was a freshman in college. I  was married at the beginning of my sophomore year. And I really feel and you can ask my own  children, this because they've also gone through this, but I still feel quite strongly, 

34:19 
you would say you're raising your family, you and Leonard in according to the traditional, traditional Chinese 

34:27 
way, well, from the standpoint of who they marry, okay, and who they want to make lifetime  commitments to as far as a family, you know, I mean, as far as friends and everything, that's great, you  know,

34:39 
you you've made it known to them that that's what you would like, I'd like to see what do you think, Susan? 

34:49 
About what about marrying outside of our race,

34:53 
being raised in a traditional Chinese way as a family and your parents wishes? It seems like that you  should marry within the culture. 

35:05 
They have a lot of priorities as to what, what kind of guys that we date, they would want us to marry a  Chinese and in our race, they haven't. To put it in a very 

35:21 
explicit 

35:22 
about what they want. So I mean, especially my mom, my dad, since he was background with blacks in  Jamaica. I mean, they were, they were the kind of the lower people and my dad was kind of like 

35:44 
was born and raised in Jamaica. He came over here to the University of Idaho to go school here. 

35:53 
So that so yeah. 

35:59 
Well, I have a saying, I mean, they're saying, Well, you shouldn't marry a black, because it's just not  appropriate. I guess that's what they're always saying. And we should always try to find a Chinese  person or oriental man or woman to marry. 

36:19 
How do you feel about that? 

36:23 
I don't know. I've never, I just kind of think about more of getting through college and finding my own  career before I even think of having somebody else to marry 

36:36 
her question. When you think of yourself as a person, you know, I think of yourself as a woman first,  you think of yourself as a Chinese woman or an American woman. 

36:50 
As think of myself as a woman, I mean, just my own self I never had. I mean, I kind of brushed off when  people ridicule me and things like that. And I just kind of, oh, well, you know, that's their own opinion  about me. I I get along with a lot of people. I mean, I work with a lot of guys. And they're, you know, I'm  there's a black person white. And there's a a person who's kind of bias of everybody, but I just kind of  like, well, I know what I'm doing. And don't tell me you know, like, just because I'm a woman or I'm a  minority that I don't know what I'm doing.

37:42 
You think let me go back on. On the way you raised the way your your parents raised you do you get a  feeling? Or do you can you tell that you were raised differently than your classmates or your or your peers? 

37:58 
In what mean Chinese 

38:00 
families say say on matters of discipline, respect of parents and elders? Do you think you have more  structure in your family,

38:11 
we're very family oriented, we have to we think of our education and family. That's a priority in our lives.  And I think it's I think it's kind of sad how, how they only want us to marry in our race. I agree. And I see  their standpoint, but it's, it's it's a modern world and you have to you're living in a white world so I think  of myself as both Chinese and American and white and stuff. I don't know. 

38:57 
You and how your social interactions who do they involve? 

39:03 
Chinese might have a lot of Chinese friends.

39:08 
And how about you Michael and and Michelle? Oh, 

39:11 
there is no Chinese people and in our class or even our school only one grade up. 

39:20 
Say we do show 

39:25 
my husband my had always enjoyed and he really believes in education. And through his effort and  persistence. Many of our Chinese when older, in our generation, not quite as modern as we are not  graduates of college, but they are good people and we tried to push them to send their children to on to  school. Even even odd A friend in Walla Walla who has a large farm. He said, Well, I don't see why my  boy have to go to agriculture school because he I can teach him all all I know. But then my husband  said, No, because he he can learn all you know, but he can also learn more from the modern  agriculture, they can produce more, and they can save more and do things more. And then also, we  have been persuading our friends in Spokane, Walla Walla, even in Pullman, you know, to send the daughters to school to the Chinese attitude is that well, our daughter's got to be married, and to her
husband's family, why should we spend the money to educate our daughters, when they can live? Live  with, with the other family anyway. But we always tell them, that it doesn't hurt for our girl to, to have a  good education and be able to support herself. In case of necessity, that men she does not have to  obey and, and do what their husbands want them to do. They have, they can make their own living, and  they can do just as well as their husbands who have a college education. So they themselves have a  college education. 

41:39 
When you were saying modern earlier, you were essentially referring to the education of the females. 

41:46 
Yes. Should they do not send their female children, even the the immigrants that come over here, if  they haven't had the wisdom of more education, they they don't send their children to college. In the  first place, it costs money. And most of the immigrants do not have enough money to send their  children to colleges. But so they so these parents have to make an extra effort to work harder, and save  more so that their children can have a good education. 

42:26 
Earlier, let's see. In your class, you will be essentially a minority in terms of number of Chinese. 

42:37 
Oh, yeah. And all of our classes, right. 

42:40 
Well, I guess the question I'm leading to is 

42:47 
your parents seem to seem to want to seem to one, your parents are making an effort to integrate  Chinese Chinese culture into your lives at the same time 

43:06 
that they're growing up in an American society? Yes. 

43:11 
I can't think of the word but it's how I hear clear here's here's a question I'll direct it to. When you were  growing up, can you describe essentially the composition of your this is also true for Mary, the  composition of your peer peer group or your classmates? 

43:29 
Okay. We were the only Chinese family the only Chinese family so therefore, we were the only Chinese  kids in school. In fact, I think Dennis was the 

43:37 
no shirt. No, Gary had her local, the Japanese. And then Cheryl. Benson. Yeah, had

43:43 
been sent. And those are the only two out of all of our and yours, you know, in the Moscow schools that  we had any Orientals at all. 

43:51 
So how did that make it different for you? Growing up in relating to your peers? 

43:58 
Yeah, we had no peers. As far as oriental peers, right. 

44:03 
But no, in terms of your class, did you feel like you were isolated? Because you were the only Chinese?  Or did you have a ready ability to mix with with everyone else? 

44:12 
Well, of course, the thing that stopped our family was the fact that we had to spend so much time in the  restaurant. And so therefore, you know, I mean, we would come home at noon, we would come home  after school and work until we closed the restaurant. And so it was more or less it. Because we had to  work and we had to do our school work and that type of thing that we didn't do as much socializing. Not  and of course, our parents didn't encourage us to do they didn't they didn't encourage us to take sports  or to join clubs and organizations. It was just work do your schoolwork and you know come home and  we tried to do things as a family. I mean, we we have the benefits of having a nice home. You know a  loving, caring family we really, in you know we were always healthy and you You know, good food, we  had good upbringing, we had piano lessons. I think some of us join, you know, like Girl Scouts and that  type of thing. And we all went to Sunday school always. And but you know, that was about the limit of it,  you know, we didn't have we couldn't do extracurricular school, things that school 

45:19 
didn't have time, per se, but they did, you know, have our friends come home because I had very, a lot  of my girlfriends that would come down to the restaurant. With me while I was working waiting tables,  they would sit down and eat, and my parents were always, you know, there to feed them or to, you  know, and then we'd all race back up to school together. So it wasn't as though and I had two groups of  friends, I had one group that were your real, you know, you're my Phi Beta Kappa group. And then I  had your other group that were the very my best friend was a very, very popular girl with a cheerleader  type and with her families that we did everything together with and and so therefore, I was with him all  the time with both both different groups, and I didn't feel any kind of it wasn't there, but you 

46:05 
are allowed to, to go to your friend's home to 

46:09 
your you know, and

46:10 
I would be invited, and then they were they, we would encourage them to have friends come into our  home. 

46:18 
Like you assess a family group. Did you feel like you were part of the community? Were you active? 

46:26 
A small? Do 

46:28 
you mean in high school as 

46:29 
far as community? 

46:33 
individually or as a family? 

46:35 
Well, community? Not so much. We were just mostly our, you know, like I say, we were we had our  restaurant, we had our hours to work at the restaurant. And yet we did. It wasn't 

46:45 
as though we are slavery. 

46:48 
No, yeah, it wasn't as though we didn't have we just didn't have time. For a lot of the different things  that like I see that Clara's kids are getting into though I was in Girl Scouts, and I worked in campfire. 

46:59 
So how is it different for for you children, for your children 

47:03 
hasn't changed much? We are what do you? What do you mean, you don't have to change match as  far as people accepting us into into the society? We have? They look beyond what color you are, what  race you are, they look for the person. They definitely do. So. I mean, sure, you'd have some people,  you know, look at the outside, and maybe make fun of you or something. But you just you have your  friends. You accept it, and you're really proud of it. So you don't let it get to you 

47:43 
know, what would happen when they want your daughters with the Caucasian?

47:54
So far, Claire doesn't like what if question is 

48:00 
I would not be accepting 

48:03 
Lenin have his say. 

48:07 
Because I would be, I would be more like my father, I'm afraid and turn off. 

48:13 
To situation, when you say turn off 

48:15 
what you see, I think, by us going on by us to having our kids go on to school. See, it's given each of  them a chance to do some more growing. So essentially, I mean, if this had happened when they were  in high school, or from, you know, right out of high school when they're only 17 or 18 years old. Whoa,  bad news. You know, he would like 

48:40 
to continue with a relationship. 

48:42 
Well, I mean, he's telling me that this is it. I mean, they're gonna get married, right? That's the indication  I got. Okay. I mean, I would be really totaled. I mean, I would, I wouldn't I like I said, at that point, I'd  react like my dad did. Okay, but if after four years after they get their degree, and after they've had this  time to do some growing, where they have also had more experiences besides just what they've gained  out of being in the Moscow community, you know, Moscow, high school, Moscow grade school, etc,  then maybe and I'm not going to, I don't you know, I don't particularly want this. 

49:17 
So your statement broadcast, 

49:18 
but possibly there might be a little bit more acceptance, 

49:22 
you'd be making a parental decision if she did it now. A freshman in high school and non college,  college and a junior in college until after they're finished with their college education, you feel compelled  to make a parental decision. According 

49:39 
to him. I have no parental decision. I mean, it's there.
 
49:44 
How about you, Leonard? 

49:45 
I don't know. I just hope that that didn't come up. Before he does, I'll be putting my two cents worth. I  would tell him a few things about out If it is, without mixing,

50:04 
well, how would you feel about that Susan? 

50:08 
about marrying? And another one? About how my 

50:13 
parents reactions, which 

50:14 
one I asked say you, you found somebody and he happens not to be Chinese and you truly are serious  about him. And your parents said no deal. 

50:25 
I don't know, I think I myself would firstly, look for that Oriental. By myself. I mean, I just feel it's, I mean,  they've been saying, you know, it's, it's good to be have something that's equal to you. And I mean, as  a race. And then besides having to feel like you have to be on your knees form or, or have, you know,  just something like that. You have just feel like you're one on one. You expand when you say oriental  view and beyond Chinese? Oh, yes.

51:06 
And that's a different way except, see, before when we were growing up, it was Chinese. Bottom line. I  mean, that was it, period. I mean, I had no choice as 

51:18 
to idea and then I can so dish. And then 

51:21 
of course, I think the might maybe dad might have been a little bit more tolerant, of course, because  Gary was the first one to kind of make the decision to go out. And, you know, had she been, you know,  oriental, rather than totally Caucasian, I think that it would have been a little easier for dad to accept.  But that wasn't the case. And of course, then dad passed away before Cheryl got married to a Persian.  And so we really, you know, don't know exactly how men, but I think that, but I 

51:51
think that you have to, like she was saying that she would give her kids these years, you know, to grow.  And then if they get married, then that then that her decision would come at that time. But I think that  you have to say that with her dad, you see his decision. It was it was after Gary had gone through  college and had been out working that he was not like a freshman or sophomore or, you know, so he  was, you know, very already said, like, you know, and he still did not accept until after the grandchildren  came. And I think that that's really, you know, so so he is, you know, even a little bit more old and older  tradition that she, you know, then then she is in that refer me, she's saying, okay, you know, when you  have your education, you have your experiences all that time. Now, she's not saying you'll have your  choice. But she says I'll look and see the situation at that time. She's at least opening herself up for it.  And dad was just very definite, no matter how much education you had, no matter what time in life, it  came that it was very definite. That was to be a Chinese. 

52:48 
How did that what probably posed for for the family? When Gary, 

52:53 
although it was a real problem fact, it was probably the only argument that I ever had with my dad. 

53:00 
You disagreed with him. 

53:02 
Well, you see Gary a myriad after he got his through his law school and into he has a job already with a  law firm. And then yes, but I think is the way Gary presented his girlfriend at the time, we were at the  Methodist church. And he came in with this girl. She's a She's a graduate of University, Idaho. She's  from southern Idaho, but she's an and Gary was sitting right next to me. And my husband was on the  left of me and he leaves he leaned over and said, What do you think of my girlfriend? You know, to me,  you know? Well, that was certainly a surprise to me, you know, he could have getting me used to  having a American girlfriend, you know, but right at church. And I don't think the ministry was preaching  at that time. But anyway, he he leaned over and told me, This is my girlfriend and we're gonna get  married. I think he said that that would have been a better way. I think it would have been a better way  when he was going with her to let me know something about it. Not a wait until we get in church to tell.  Tell me let me is the decision had already been made that they were gonna get married and said this is  a neat hour. He didn't need it and we're gonna get married. You know, that? Just kind of 

54:54 
well, I think too is because you know, actually mom is the one that's a lot more tolerant. Yes. I If she's  more open, and she's been more always more accepting, okay, and I don't know if it was an insecurity  on Gary's part or just not be able to totally see the situation, but he really should include mom in  because I think mom, but he was the first one to break this tradition, you know. And so he probably felt  really insecure about the whole situation that you're in. But, you know, the same thing happened. 

55:26
Maybe he thought at church, I could not do anything, you know, I have to keep keep quiet, at least until  after we got out of the chair. And you know, 

55:37 
I mean, the same thing happened to us, you know, when we invited the chins to come up for lunch, his  graduation and for our engagement party. And he had really not said anything about me to his family.  And all of a sudden, he writes a letter, you know, mom and dad, since you're not going to be able to  come up for graduation, I've decided that we're going to have our engagement without you. And whoa,  they didn't know what a Claire was, you know, and because, you know, we've been going together for a  year, and they had no clue. And man, they flew up to his graduation, they took us, you know, over to  Seattle for the World's Fair for our engagement party. And the whole works. I mean, that's how fast the  turnaround was. And so, I mean, it was kind of the same situation. And it was, you know, so I think that  No parent wants to see that type of thing just dropped on their lap like that. So that's a good 

56:24 
point that in fact, perhaps a universal parents to be eased into the situation, right? 

56:31 
That's right. But I was all all for Gary, getting married to the girl, the girl has her education, and she's a  nice girl and good and healthy. That's one of the main things that we look for daughter in law, you  know. And so I go right along with it. And I watched it. I went to the wedding. My husband did not attend  that wedding. He just stayed home. But he said the kid everybody said, Just give me a year to get used  to this, you know, but wouldn't have been here even before the children were born by a he accepted her. 

57:13 
No, Mom, it was not until after in fact, was I wouldn't have to say it wasn't until Daniel, 

57:19 
oh, I 

57:21 
wasn't that it doesn't matter. It didn't matter to me, it was a kid. So your dad that whether they have just  girls or boys, my husband had never distinguished having just, you know, catering to the boys to the  disadvantage to the girls. Every one of our children had had their education all planned for them while I  was still pregnant. So So I thought, you know, he and I had did the best we could do what what we  have 

58:02 
that seems to go along with your description of your family as being more modern. Yes. Is that you  don't make the distinction between male and female? No, 

58:11 
that's for sure. Actually,

58:12 
it's more I guess I was picking up out of his family. Yeah. 

58:17 
That was more old fashioned. That boys are much more important than girls. In fact, we had three girls  two girls before we had a boy and my mother my parents was was a little bit worried. Then we had boys  and my other brother in Canada had a boy and then one in Miami had a boy what 

58:38 
what's the importance to having a boy sort of 

58:41 
sunken carry them through the line in the name and the line will always have gone through the mail.  The Orientals you know I can't say too much about the Japanese or Filipinos or anything like that but I  know the Chinese people feel that if they have boys that that they have the boys need to take care of them and carry on the name and he'll be there low spot in the world. So I'm gonna stop here. You guys relax.
