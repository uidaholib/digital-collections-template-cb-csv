Very, not very often 

00:25 
asked them to the farmer in that area or does 

00:31 
he know that it's a pretty big percentage, especially in Eastern Oregon and Western Idaho, especially  Ontario area in the Nampa Caldwell area oh the percentage is not that big. I don't even I hate to  venture to say what percentage I've never studied that way. Ontario Oregon has a lot of Japanese  American farmers. Because I know California because it's such a deadly pharmacy so well and there's  usually other fears there. There has been sort of an undercurrent I've talked to my brother in law's one  of the biggest farmers was biggest farmers. He's not a farmer. Now he was the individual biggest  farmer in the Ontario area. He is not farming nobody is in the produce shipping business onions, solely  shipping onions to all parts of the country. But I would say the Ontario area was early earlier accepted.  More so than an apple called malaria. That's my own No. idea. But generally speaking, we're as well  accepted in the community by everyone as well as anywhere else in the country, I believe better so  than some other places. 

02:08 
I was also invited to join Elks I complained about it because I couldn't so when they moved the  restrictions and said we could well 

02:25 
I joined so I pendant very active, but I did join us very first nice day to join the Elks Lodge in Napa. 

02:37 
Getting back your bowling career that seems to be part of a central part of your current self esteem self  a little bit about your ability as a bowler 

02:47 
go I was probably a little better than the average. As far as bowling goes. I want to have a few titles. But  being a proprietor I wasn't trying to be such a good bowler as being a good proprietor. I currently down  to a 12 pound ball. Most good bowlers throw 15 or 16 pounds but I'm kind of my age and my back  
problems I'm down to a 12 pound ball but last year I average 180 which is above the mean the average  bowler for male bowler is about 160 between 55 and 60 so I'm still above the average but 

03:36 
Wilson pretty high scores 

03:37 
over the years I bowls few high scores 

03:46 
everybody expected of me you know in the business you can ball every day you know you don't have to  work you could just practice everyday you ought to be good. Everybody thought I should be averaging  200 Plus, which I only did one year even today they think well you get to practice every day for nothing.  No wonder you're good. That isn't true. I don't go bowling becomes work now. Three games a week is  the most I bowl and and it's because I'm in the business. 

04:24 
My highest sanctioned in league play was a 290 game, but I've had 299 four different times in matches  which are not sanctioned you know. And bowling for money, but not in league or tournament. So they  don't mean as much if you do it in a sanctioned competition, which is a league or tournament, it does  mean a lot but the difficulty is the same. 

04:59 
One of the things In the destructive as you have mentioned with the person who wanted to sell the loan,  we had another buyer and the other virus specifically 

05:09 
asked. Yes. Well, I used to go with him. And I ended against him also, he bought out half interest. First,  a year before I entered the business and mainly because I knew him I guess. And he was Caucasian,  but he picked me for wanted me for a partner. And there was two three others that wanted the part of  the business. He asked me to be his partner, that's why I did and through he died of a heart attack in  hordes was several years ago now. 

06:00 
One of the reasons why I asked this is that, he said it was like thinking 

06:04 
5155 I bought in 55, 

06:09 
because one of the propagandas that was swirling around during the war, before the world, Japanese  Americans could not be trusted. And so here's the southern they trusted us and wanted me to do. 

06:23
I had known him for a few years through bowling. I started bowling in Nampa 1948. So I actually knew  him for seven years before I got into the business. And until then, I was farming. 

06:40 
He's a member program. Where are you right now? strictly a farming community? 

06:45 
No, there's manufacturing. There is a manufacturing but farming is the backbone of the economy. This  kind of thing. Okay. The changes is they make trailers mobile home. Zilog has been in Napa for seven  years. And they've made plans to enlarge double their capacity. And Zilog makes computer chips and  
parts. We have the world's largest sugar refinery in Napa, the Amalgamated Sugar Company. And of  course in the Colville area, Jr. Simpler, which is well known for potato processing is headquartered in  Cowell. And one of the largest one of the larger supermarket chain, well known here also is the  Albertson Joy Albertson headquarters are in. Of course, that's Boise, but we call that home two or 15  minutes away. So that whole southwest Idaho, senators are on there. 

08:07 
Sorry for sticking around a little bit. But another thing that interested in when we're talking was in recent  years, you want it to tell you your story. But exactly what I was wondering if you were involved at all, in  the rica scandal? 

08:24 
Yes, I was. I happen to be the area coordinator for the redress in the last four years in southwest Idaho. 

08:39 
The reason I think education is necessary because a lot of people still have wrong conception about us.  And the reasons they use for the evacuation order have proven to be false. Subsequently, a lot of this  was not known until 10 years ago. So I do I don't hesitate anymore to tell people about the experiences  that I experience. If you would ask me this 15 years ago, I wouldn't have Well, like I say, I've kind of  mellowed I guess. I gotten over the disappointment I had and went through hardships or went through  on economy evacuation. But there are people that need to know and people that would understand if  they got the story. But if they just read propaganda, and listened to it, and never been told, they would  carry that on they'd be teaching that to their children and continuously grow. This experience that we  went through should never happen to any group of people hereafter 

10:01 
My father is one of those who does not like to talk about the Capitol, and how difficult it was for you to  get individuals to come and talk about the experience. 

10:12 
Well, I had some close, you know, friends and relatives who spent time with me, and we settled out  here in Idaho, at the same time, but we get when we get together, we don't talk about the time we  spent, I think it's just natural to try to forget something that's a bad memory. It doesn't disappear. But  some, some occasion like this, I have to stop and think back, you know,

10:44 
was it difficult to get into the 

10:47 
yes, a lot of people, a lot of people thought that we should leave it go, you know, not bring it up again.  And for a while when this talk started, I was undecided. Myself, but more I think about it. I think it should  be I thought it should have been sought after. And so I became active in working towards it. On the JCL  chapter level and the district council level of the JCL. Our area belongs to the inner mountain District  Council have the JSL fact I've spent over 20 years as an officer of one source or other for the last 20  years plus continuously. So 

11:46 
what is going to change 

11:49 
mainly in from our area around here is to raise funds for the group to pursue it in Washington DC. It has  taken a lot of time and money over 10 years. Until last year. 

12:16 
Also during the Warriors, when the camps were in, were being filled with Japanese Americans in  tourney's, the inner mountain District Council, at which time I was not active, because that was going  back to 1942. Three was the only area in the whole country that carried on the work of the JCL because  all the others were in camp. The bulk of the JCL membership was in Oregon, Washington, Idaho. And  they were all from the West Coast and they were in camps. So they weren't able to do anything. Fun  work of raising money and carry on the work of it was all done out of Salt Lake City, which was the  national headquarters until we moved to San Francisco. To those people that were relocated in the  inner mountain district did most of the work of raising funds and carrying on the work of 

13:25 
where were people from who relocated for work remotely. And 

13:33 
most of the people that were in Minidoka came from Seattle area. Seattle and Tacoma, there's a few  from Tacoma. But the bulk of the internees at Minidoka from Seattle, 

13:49 
USA, most of them went back and 

13:53 
most of them went back. Here's a few that settled. Heart Mountain in Wyoming. There's only two or  three families that relocated and stayed there that I know there might have been a few more but that's a  small, a very small percentage. There's a few from Minidoka that resettled in Idaho. Twin Falls has a  half a dozen Nampa Boise area has I don't know the exact count but probably two dozen families most 
of them are farmers at one time, then since then, we have I have a brother in law was worked in a post  office he retired his older brother was a postmaster call for five six years before he retired. Yeah, most  of them in the farming industry in agriculture. 

14:55 
What was like one thing? 

14:58 
Camp life ice went to winters severe cold that we weren't used to coming from Seattle area and real hot  summers that we weren't used to the lack of privacy and that was one of the worst. Of course the  cramped quarters. When I went back into camp I had my mother and two sisters and my wife and I  baby in the 20 by 20 foot room. So you can imagine no running water, just bare lightbulbs hanging  down from the ceiling, no partitions no toilets. It was a community toilet. I guess by the time I went  there, it was a little better used to be they didn't have toilets. It was outdoor without water. Those that  went in opened up the camp and then a dhoka had the worst of it. That was dusty when they got there  in August, July and August Dustin ankle deep then in September October the rain snow came and it  just got mud. You leave your shoes in the mud you know I mean it slip off of you know sidewalks but by  the following summer, the ingenuity and and in character the Japanese American people both young  and old, transformed that camp to a garden. They planted flowers. And of course the farm itself. There  was a quite a bit of quite a few acres of farm to raise the crops to feed the people there it was almost  self sufficient as far as farm products go. And when they left the camp and the camp was close, most of  the yards had flowers and everything growing on it. They had sidewalks were put in the roads were  blacktop. Today there is one standing barracks that used to be the fire station and is still standing I  talked to a farmer that homesteaded this one of the area's there and he was the first one to homestead  or after we left and I think he said 1940s six or 45 He's lived there continuously since it was a desert but  it's it's all nice farms now. But when when the camp was first opened up there was just out it's only  about two miles from the highway but you can't see it from the highway. There was water handy right  there close by big canal there. So they pumped the water in and made the desert bloom. 

18:02 
Do you know where other counts similar to Randolph in terms of the residents actually making a flower  and grow? 

18:11 
Pretty much so I understand. I've read some articles on it. Just about everywhere did that Yes. You  know the Japanese like flowers and plants. And they were good with it. So they did that 

18:32 
well, I didn't have to raise him in camp when he was two months old. We moved out a camp and he's  never been a resident never camp. 

18:43 
Question If you were under under guard for the camp, how you

18:50 
Okay, good question. Camp men adore Minidoka was one of the camps that have very little internal  problems with men with authorities and their internees there. I have never heard of any incident general  run ins with the governing body. They let us govern ourselves anyway. But I mean, anyone trying to  escape, something like that never happened at Minidoka. It had happened some other of the other  senators. In fact, I met recently, as last year. A man who's retired now and living in Idaho Falls, said  that he guarded three camps. He was a youngster. 19 years old. He was an MP at all three of them. 

19:48 
And he was at Tulelake gave him the most trouble. And he was also at Topaz and so Southern Utah 

20:02 
there was one or two incidents there. But he came to Camp Minidoka and he said, no problems at all there.
