# Transcript of a Draft of the Program “Other Faces, Other Lives”

01:02 
Idaho one of the most rugged and beautiful north western states. We picture espoused people by  Native Americans and white explorers, settlers and pioneers, little is ever said about other races.  However, Asians have played an important part in working the minds, constructing the railroads,  cultivating the farms, establishing the businesses, teaching the children and helping to build this great  western state. Although there is occasional mention of Chinese miners, few people realize that in 1870,  during Idaho's Gold Rush, over 1/4 of the people in Idaho were Chinese, and that Boise, the population  center was 1/3 Chinese, though many whites tried to treat the Chinese miners farmers and business  people fairly. The story of the early Chinese in Idaho were laced with suspicion, prejudice and  discrimination. The ones large Chinatown located in Boise is now gone by the Chinese have had a  continuous presence in Idaho from the time of statehood to the present day. The Japanese came to  Idaho starting in the 1880s to work on the railroad. Many stayed the farm and then branched out into  other occupations. But we seldom talk about the fact then in 1943, the eighth largest population center  in Idaho was completed dhoka a Japanese internment camp in the desert, north of Twin Falls. 1000s of  Japanese Americans were brought there after being forced from their homes on the West Coast. Living  in hastily constructed bare and crowded barracks. They did their best to make the area livable by  cultivating gardens to literally make the desert bloom. The story continues to the present day as  Filipinos and Southeast Asians come to Idaho looking for a better life. Like the earlier Asians, they tried  hard to fit into an unfamiliar, often unfriendly environment, while at the same time remaining true to their  heritage and beliefs. These brave and hardworking Asians show us all other faces of Idaho. This  program of other faces other lives was made by people of Chinese, Japanese and Filipino ancestry,  who are members of the Palouse Asian American Association of Northern Idaho and Eastern  Washington. It is a project supported by the Idaho Centennial Commission ethnic heritage committee.  They traveled the state to uncover some of the unwritten and untold stories of what it was like and is  like to be Asian American in Idaho. Do the Asians blend in? Or do they maintain their own culture? How  do they raise their children? How are they treated by the white neighbors? Do they feel at home in  Idaho? Are things changing for the better or the worse for them? How do children feel who are often the  only Asians in their classes or school? Listen in, as we raised these questions in interviews and  discussions, and learn about an often neglected part of the story of Idaho. Murray lelou came to the  United States from China when she was 16 years old. She was the first Asian to graduate from the  University of Idaho. in Spokane, her father was a Chinese ER doctor. In 1926, the family moved to  Moscow, Idaho, where they were the first Chinese family to settle as permanent residents. Her family  owned and operated the grill Cafe, which is now the old Hong Kong restaurant on Main Street. Marie  married Milu and they raised five children, two of their daughters hers. Mary Lou and Claire chin are  currently teachers in nearby towns. In the 1920s, gaining the acceptance of the white community was  difficult. And to this day, the loose and chants face occasional prejudice. But Marie and her family have found that their Chinese values of strong family unity and hard work have helped them to find a true  home in Moscow, Idaho. 

05:30 
How come that we went into the restaurant business was the my father and mother came around he  said, Well, let's go around the police country see what it is like you know, so they came over here and  went to Moscow and went to a house cafe to get my little sister, three year old sister some cookies.  before they left the house cafe they they bought the cookies and the cafe. So that's how come we  started in Moscow. We have the restaurant starting at July the third I remember that because we  wanted to have the business of July the fourth. 

06:13 
People who see the sewer Naga family shopping at the mall in Pocatello, or fishing for trout on Henry's  fork probably do not realize that they are descended from samurais of ancient Japan. Now, Richard sua  Nagas young grandson, Richard the second, learns the ancient Japanese martial arts in Pocatello,  Idaho. Richards start in Idaho was a bitter one. Even though he was a second generation American,  Richard had to face hatred and suspicion during World War Two. Eventually, his hard work and  dependability triumphed. He established suenaga masonry now run by his son who who is active in  community affairs. His wife Merica sigh. A former dancer who is born and raised in Idaho has  introduced 1000s of Pocatello children to the art of dance. She has taught dance classes throughout  the country, including Los Angeles, Houston, Las Vegas and San Francisco. 

07:21 
Deputies community here the nice as you know, they were held dances every once in a while well, she  didn't have a date and I didn't have a date and the guy said I'll get your good date. So that's how I got to nerds. 

07:36 
Paul and scenario Camorra have lived in the Pocatello area all their lives. Paul is a retired farmer,  having taken over his father's truck gardening business. His father was killed in an accident while  helping a neighbor put out a fire. Sanaya is a retired elementary school teacher. She is quite proud of  her teaching record and pleased that she received kind words from her former students and their  parents. The old cameras were founding members of the Pocatello chapter of the JA CL the Japanese  American Citizens League. The Pocatello chapter was established in 1940 and Paul Okamura was  president in 1941 when it received its charter, one of the slogans of the J ACL is better Americans in a  greater America. The J ACL has 900 members in the Intermountain district of Utah and Idaho and 113  chapters nationwide. 

08:46 
There were a lot of Orientals working for the railroad. And however, my father didn't work for the  railroad. Oh, I don't know, couple of years or so. And then he started a little garden on the edge of  town. And as a town grew, he had quit his little gardening project moved farther out, away from the city  and went into general farming.

09:19 
say gee Hi ashita was brought to Idaho during World War Two when he was ordered from his farm in  Bellevue, Washington, and relocated in the Minidoka internment camp. After the war, Seiji settled in the  Nampa area. He eventually became the first Japanese American bowling center proprietor in the state  of Idaho, and possibly in the United States. His son, who was born in the internment camp, is the first  Asian American teacher in the Nampa school system, and was recently voted Outstanding Educator.  For many years, Seiji did not speak of his experience at the internment camp. But now he feels it is  important that the story be told and remembered. He was one of those instrumental in the Idaho  Centennial project, establishing a memorial and plaque at the side of the Minidoka camp. And he was  present at the groundbreaking ceremony there 

10:23 
$500 separated whether he was going to buy that farm or her lease and we kept leasing it, year to year lease. So when I went back everything that I had left farm equipment, furniture, household belongings,  you know, because he's only allowed to carry a suitcase a piece. There was somebody living in the  house, not the person that I left it in charge of. We showed me a government bill of sale for everything.  So I couldn't, there was an irrigation system on a little farm too and stuff. So I go back then had to start  from scratch. There was nothing there. So I stayed out in Idaho. So I happen to be one of the few that  was from Bellevue. In fact, I'm the only one from Bellevue that's still in Idaho. 

11:17 
Filipino Americans are often called the invisible minority. They seldom congregate in special  neighborhoods like China towns, and Little Tokyo, as their Chinese and Japanese counterparts often  did. Unlike the Chinese and Japanese, early Filipino immigrants came from a territory of the United  States, and they were brought up saluting and pledging allegiance to the American flag in grade school.  The first Filipinos to come to the United States mainland in the 1920s were mainly farm laborers and  how servants but Latter Day immigrants are largely college educated, and are most prominent in  service fields, such as medicine, engineering, and administration. 

12:06 
Currently on administrator with the Department of Agriculture, my work I deal with the legislature or with  the farming community. The Commission's in the States. They mentioned being commission of alpha  growers. I'm involved in certifying Idaho products to be exported to different countries. 

12:39 
Early Asian settlers came to America to make their fortunes and start new lives. They did not find the  streets lined with gold, but they did find the streets lined with opportunities. After the first generations  established themselves, they looked to education to help give their children better lives. 

13:04 
The earlier the earlier Filipinos that came I think is the equivalent of what the Mexicans are now. They  were the laborers. That was the first wave of migration. 

13:17
When we first came here, really I was lost. Because when we came here, we saw only Well, my son  was the only Filipino here. But then, a month later, we saw another Filipino married to American. Then  from there, I tried to inquire where Filipinos are Filipinos are if there are any Filipinos around. When we  were having about say maybe about five or six families, we started to have we pay inspire them to that  we should be having a community. 

14:07 
So I think most of them that came over our parents that came over they were looking for a better life. I  think like most Issei parents, they came with a dream of making and saving money. Quick and going  back to Japan. I think that was their intent. From what I have gathered, talking to older people, most of  them who are gone. My dad died at the age of 60. So I was 21 at the time, but he told me that that's  what he planned to do. But in the meantime money didn't grow on trees like they thought it was going to  be so he was then he started a family. So you know it was the gave up idea of going back. I think that's  probably the way most of the families that settle here. Some of those that came a little late To the  country before immigration was stopped somewhere educated people, and they started businesses  when they came here. But the very first ones that come over we started working on farms started  working on railroads start working coal mines, mining. 

15:21 
About 1920, the winter of 1920. I remember it was wintertime, because the first time I saw Snow was,  was when we came over by boat into Seattle, the Port of Seattle. And I saw the snow I said, Well,  what's what's all this on the ground, you know? Well, they expect to either No, and that's what I saw  that and, and then my father went into Seattle to bring us back to Spokane. And then the first thing after  we got home was, I heard my father talking, and next room, I knew there was nobody there, you know, I  can't understand what he was doing. So I went around, he was talking on the telephone. That's the first  time I knew about the telephone. So about later on, in, I think the first semester in 1921. I started in  grade school at the Hawthorne school in Spokane. 

16:18 
I was just so thankful that, you know, my grandparents, both mom's parents, mom's dad, and also,  Grandpa Lou had the foresight to leave China. And to give us the opportunities that we had, you know,  for being Americans, it was just, I mean, it was just unreal, I just could not have imagined myself  growing up. In in China, 

16:41 
the United States has the best opportunity for everybody and anybody. I know, I know, one thing, if a  person is, is healthy, and willing to work, they never have to starve. Not in the United States, 

16:58 
I feel good. When I was growing up, there were a lot of people who went out of their way to do to do a  lot of things for me. And without those kinds of things that other people did for me, I don't think I would  be what I am now. So 

17:16
I was born in beautiful Idaho, which is a tiny, tiny, little community remind my folks had a restaurant  there. And then from there, they moved to show shown and eventually moved to black but and we had  a restaurant there. Then later on, during the Depression, they had to give it up because of business,  you know. And they kept going in debt. So they finally gave that up. And then we moved to Pocatello. 

17:48 
He came over, more or less to make his fortune as I think the general people the man especially did at  that time, 

18:02 
my father came over from Japan when he was just a young fellow about 16 years old. And he never  ever did go back. My mother came as a picture bride. So they, I don't know whether you're familiar with  that. But, you know, pictures were sent back and forth. But usually the fan was about when was that  1918. And usually, the families back in Japan knew each other, or they because they would say now, if  your son would marry my daughter, you know, so on and so forth, you know. So that's how come the  pictures would stock up going back and forth, and they would correspond. So my mother came over  that way. 

18:52 
I think a student here who wants to go to college, is highly motivated would have a better chance of  going to college and finishing college than the one who's in the Philippines, who wants to go to college  and doesn't have the resources to go to college, even though he's highly motivated. I mean, the  chances are, he won't go and finish college. 

19:11 
I have benefited from not only the tradition of knowing my grandma, my grandparents on both sides,  and I guess cherishing those memories, but even also being fostered in in an environment where  education was a very key role. And I think that that's an outstanding element in most Japanese families.  But it's not a direct education, so to speak. It's an application to life, my parents would share going to  where we would travel, and it wouldn't matter whether it was from here to black fit or go to a foreign  country and they would save up and they would give my sister and I the benefits of traveling. And they  taught us that probably 99% of our education would come through travel and learning to deal with  people in our circumstances that they were, I guess, smart enough to qualify that statement and say  that without a formal education, we'd never truly be able to appreciate those experiences. 

20:16 
My husband and I had always enjoyed, and he really believes in education. And through his effort and  persistence, many of our Chinese Quinn, older friends in our generation, not quite as modern as we  we're not graduates of college, but they are good people. And we tried to push them to send their  children to onto school. We have been persuading our friends in Spokane, Walla Walla, even in  Pullman, you know, to send the daughters to school to the Chinese attitude is that well, our daughter's  gonna be married and to her husband's family, why should we spend the money to educate our  daughters when they go live? Live with with the other family anyway. But we always tell them that it 
doesn't hurt for a girl to to have a good education and be able to support herself, in case of necessity.  That then she does not have to obey and, and do what their husbands want them to do. 

21:40 
We tell them studying is their first job right now. That's their main job. Later on, they'll have their own  job, which is probably not studying. Right now the nature of 

21:56 
the various Asian groups have different views on intermarriage. Although many of the first generation  Asians strongly preferred their children to marry within their respective groups. Life in America has led  to many inter marriages, succeeding generations have had to struggle to reconcile their parents values  with the realities of life in Idaho. 

22:23 
Them going to school is going to school, and you have no time to be dating. And so he said, Well, wait  till they're at least a junior at college before me the junior No, but he didn't like to have you do it. But he  did not forbid you to do it. 

22:45 
I was married by the time I was a sophomore. In other words, he let he let us go out as long as it's the  right person, right and the right person had to be 

22:56 
Chinese. Not not that not that we have anything against the American people. It is much better. If you  do marry within your own race, you have a background together, the same background the same as the  same heart cultures and the same ideas that the Chinese people have. 

23:25 
We have heard that Filipinos have a very high intermarriage rate. Can you comment on that? 

23:35 
That's where I can see. That's what I can see. Because my son is married to American and my, well my  other son is married to Japanese. And my other son is married to American. I mean, my daughter is  married to American teachers. Yeah, she married to American so that's what it is. They're all I don't  have any pure Filipino children.

24:08 
Why why do you think that is? So? Yeah, good question. I. 

24:14 
Well, the reason? Well, I really can't say anything about that. But I think the reason is that we don't  have many of our people in care. You see, when he was still a minister in California, the early part of  his ministry, they did not allow marriages intermarry, this like that. So, so he cannot marry. So we have been bringing these people who wants to marry another nationality to renew. In fact, we have brought  about seven of them 

24:54 
into that so when you say they can you clarify that who would not allow 

24:59 
it The Law belong in California, California, California, maybe maybe in United States, I didn't know how  I didn't know this. But in California, they didn't. It was not allowed for, for intermediate intermarriages.  So he can marry them. 

25:17 
So Reverend Carla, when you would take them to Reno? Yes. 

25:27 
Well, how did you feel about the intermarriage show? What do you think of intermarriage? 

25:35 
I went so far, like, I have been talking to him that in my observation here, all those there are many that  we know, who are as good as when they are Filipinos, are they're Americans, it's themselves see that  there are many that I know that we deal with, that they have the best husbands, they have the, the,  they're the best husbands in the American side. 

26:11 
The races have been able to mix them and be a cohesive group. You know, I always thought that when  I when I was younger, I had a friend who was Caucasian, and I, it was a very dear friend, because we  live he just lived down the street aways and, and if something came up, and he proposed to me, I still  as much as I thought of him, I wouldn't have thought of marrying him because at the time, Caucasians  were, you know, and Japanese married just just didn't go. And they had all these laws to that, that  regulated us from. So since that time, it's really been almost a complete turnover. And because we  have children in on his side of the famine, and mine, too, who are married to Caucasians, and doing  very nicely and I think I think just as much of the daughter in law's is if you know if they were Japanese  and I think the grandchildren naturally. They're just your grandkids and just extra special. And like you  say we've got blonde, and darn near blonde, blue eyes and curly hair, you know, I said I'm, I've often  wondered how mother would think if she saw curly haired granddaughter or grandchild, because in all  in Japanese always have straight black hair. And here we have our grandchildren who have pretty curly  brown hair and beautiful all his complexion and everything. And somehow I feel like that they are,  they're better looking. There's much more intelligent in school. I mean, all children, you know, I've done  very well on school. So far, so they always talk about hybrids, you know, the first strain of a hybrid  being so good, whether it's wheat or corn or whatever. I kind of think that with children, too. 

28:17 
We, each of us, when we graduated from high school, went to Hawaii for a summer. Yeah, of course,  we had been raised, you know, amongst, you know, in Moscow, in essentially an all Caucasian community atmosphere. And so when I went to Hawaii was the first time I had been immersed into, you  know, a multicultural setting. And I realized when I came back, that my dad was right, and that I would  marry within my, you know, with, at least within the Orientals. And so then Leonard and I started,  Leonard already had was working on his master's. And so we started dating when I was a freshman in  college. I was married at the beginning of my sophomore year. And I really feel and you can ask my  own children, this because they've also gone through this, but I still feel quite strongly, you would 

29:07 
say you're raising your family, you and Leonard, in according to the traditional, traditional Chinese

29:14 
way, well, from the standpoint of who they marry, okay, and who they want to make lifetime  commitments to as far as a family. 

29:23 
How do you feel about that? 

29:26 
I don't know. I never. I just kind of think about more of you getting through college and finding my own  career before I even think of having somebody else to marry. 

29:40 
They have a lot of priorities as to what what kind of guys that we date, they would want us to marry a  Chinese and in our race. I agree. And I see their standpoint, but it's, it's it's a modern world and you  have to If you're living in a white world, so I think of myself as both Chinese and American and white and stuff 

30:10 
Lutece parents were, I'm sure a bit apprehensive, more for her sake, I think than mine. You they were  concerned that she wouldn't finish school that she had been a valedictorian and all of these things in  school and they had great aspirations for her. She had great aspirations and they thought when she  married somebody, somebody from college. Gonna go. I think it's worked out alright. 

30:44 
I think it's also, you know, parents never tell you really what, you know, how they feel. I mean, it's part  of the culture they infer, right? I mean, it's all in for, and I think my mom has inferred to me that when  she goes all in on, I won't be there as a girl, you know, usually the woman take care of your aging  parents. And, and he was quite, she was quite apprehensive about that. But I won't be around, of  course, because then I, you know, I follow my husband. And so what she was born. 

31:12 
So how is it? No, 

31:15
she comes every two years, sometimes with my mom or with just a mom, I mean, with my dad, and she  comes into visit and I tell her you know, when she needs me, I'll be ready. Around my kids do so. 

31:32 
My mother would have been worried if I married somebody else, just you know, be sure you know what  you're doing. Be sure it works. No specific rate 

31:43 
of divorce. Everybody in America gets divorced. 

31:47 
At the time, the time we were going to get married. Another one from Los monos. My hometown. I was  in the process of getting divorced with his American wife, who happens to be a good family friend. So  that was something that my mother as well. Are you aware of this? Are you aware of that? I? Of course  said yes. But like any ideal is it ever happened to me? 

32:20 
All Asian groups have experienced forms of discrimination. In early days, there were laws preventing  Asians from becoming citizens and owning land. Prejudice was extreme against the Japanese  Americans during World War Two. An unfortunate example of this was the construction of Camp Minidoka. For 1000s of Japanese Americans were interned. 

32:47 
I'm proud to be a Japanese American. Now. I wasn't, I was always proud of that. But it meant a lot of  trouble during the war years. But having weathered the storm and went through all the troubles, and  getting through it, you know, in good shape. I always say that I'm proud to be a Japanese American. 

33:17 
I've been here ever since 1920. But I could not become a US citizen until 1943. Paul Buck was one of  the persons that got this law change in the US government. And so as soon as we were able to join, my  husband and I a went to get our citizenship paper at that time. And if you're not a citizen, of course, you  cannot buy land or building or anything like that. So at that time, you have to Buyten your children's  name, because they are citizens and they are allowed to buy. And we cannot even vote all these years  until after we become citizens. 

34:06 
I had to do a little bit better in order to succeed. See, that's been that way throughout my life. If I want to  hold down a job, no matter what, I had to put out a little bit more effort to be a little bit better than  anything I do. So keep my low depression, some that hold on to me and get rid of the others. But if I  were equal, I would have been the first one to let off. That is a racially because if you're competing with  a bunch of Caucasians, you're you're just mud unless you excel in your ability a little bit better. 

34:41
There was quite a bit of prejudice against Chinese people at that time. And we saw many customers,  you know, just walk past our door and went to some pre sales because we're Chinese people. They  just wouldn't come in 

35:01 
My neighbor, Caucasian friends, we went fishing. And on the way we stopped at a restaurant and I  want to eat some trip because it's a shrimp so much. And the guy poked me you gonna eat that bug? I  said, What do you mean bug? Yeah, that's a seafood. It's real good. And the guy said, Well, my mother  told me that you shouldn't eat shrimp for bass bugs. And I ate it boy with gusto. You know? And the guy  looked at I said, Boy, that must be good. You should like it. Don't just be sure I do. Is it give me a pitch?  I saw I didn't want I said, Hey, this is good. I can't wait isn't a bug. And a lot of the people were like that. 

35:42 
I stopped, it was a noon hour. So I thought I'd stop and my wife and my son was about a year and a  half years old. 

35:54 
Stopped at a restaurant there and didn't get waited on. And finally the waitress came over and said, Are  you Japanese nicer to Japanese descent? Yes. Well, we don't serve you. So I think she was more  embarrassed than I was. But we left 

36:12 
call me names. Having to do with my race. It takes me more personal than if they tell me that I'm ugly.  Because you are aware. I think it takes me it. It bothers me more because they're insulting my whole  race. They're insulting my whole background. And what I believe in, and that's that's worse to me than  somebody calling me something that really is offended. 

36:38 
didn't flinch was the dean a woman at that time? You know, I she had a good talk with my sisters as  well. You must go out with American boys too much, you know, I mean, but of course my sister didn't  go overboard, but she have her regular friends. So well. If the other students can keep can keep the  boyfriends why why why can I you know, go out on dates with them. 

37:13 
Camp life, I spent two winters severe cold that we weren't used to coming from Seattle area and real hot summers that 

37:26 
we weren't used to 

37:29 
the lack of privacy and that was one of the worst. And of course, the cramped quarters. When I went  back into camp, I had my mother and two sisters and my wife and I baby in the 20 by 20 foot room. So  you can imagine no running water just bear light bulbs hanging down from the ceiling. No partitions. No 
toilets was a community toilet. I guess by the time I went there, it was a little better used to be they  didn't have toilets. It was outdoor without water. Those that went and opened up the camp and then a  dhoka had the worst of it. That was dusty when he got there in August, July and August. Dustin ankle  deep. Then in September, October, the rain snow came and it just got mud. You leave your shoes in  the mud. You know what I mean? It slip off. 

38:36 
As long as the country realizes that we need immigrants to help us in our industries and our labor  supply. I don't think it will happen. But when that happens, though, then we probably have some people  in Washington who don't realize the significance of keeping our industries moving or keeping our  society far develop or far more developed than other countries like Japan or Europe, 

39:05 
rapid sea that he share a heading or San Pedro San Francisco we headed east and I knew we're going  to Mexico I didn't have I didn't I didn't know how to navigate to like me. I had a Skipper's license to hold  on hold on suitable. And by doing that it took us about 15 days to get back from Hawaii but we finally  ended up in San Pedro see our home port was was in San Francisco. Well, we got in okay, then you  know who's waiting for me? Guess who? The FBI. Now about a dozen. They come up and they  grabbed me and says now don't you get away you're gonna get off the ship. We don't crush you. 

39:51 
I know that a lot of people at my school like me, but they always know that I'm there for them when they need me. 

40:04 
Do they know that your app Japanese? No. 

40:09 
I don't care well, 

40:12 
to any of the kids that you play with, give you trouble because you have Japanese? 

40:19 
No, but there's one kid who gave when I was at my little girl school. 

40:25 
But that wasn't because you were Japanese. Just because you're 

40:31 
30 years old. 

40:35
I'm the only I'm the only Filipinos in, in my profession that I know. And when I go to staffing, I know  people if they, you know, I initially they have, they would. I don't think it's making fun, but they would  call attention to like to some how I would pronounce some words. And I, you know, I think, I don't know,  I I've never experienced that before we I was an exchange student before and, and wasn't that, you  know, not much attention was was given at that time. But here, it seems to me that maybe people are  not used to other culture as much or, you know, like we were saying before, there's that veneer of  discrimination maybe to other than, you know, to a culture other than your own. 

41:28 
I think is true, just as any other person, because we've been friends for two and a half years now. And  no difference. No, I like him because he's steroid. Yeah. Because different or anything. 

41:49 
For you, a youngster don't realize that any of you don't realize what happened to us. But right now, the  far Pocatello goes, I think it's a good time. I wouldn't be anywhere else.

42:03 
If there if there's any discrimination right now, it's probably more than a positive point. And a negative, I  think those that are still continuing to discriminate are probably a little bit ignorant of the facts. You  know, when I say a positive discrimination, I think, I think because of because of my father, and people  like him and our grandfathers, and they earned the right, they earned that respect, I think from from this  community and the country in general. And so if anything, it's it's more a matter of pride now to be  Japanese, because so much more is expected of you. But it's it's a wonderful challenge that I think that  we're as a race, I think we're up to 30 children during the day being discriminated against, no, I again, I  feel that they're looked up to the they adapt, and they accept all of the different races very, very well. In  fact, you know, one of the things that I'm happy to say is that when someone else for example, a black  is discriminated, my children can understand that and they usually side with that poor unfortunate. 

43:18 
I had never had to face a problem that was off my series. So I said to him, Well, have you had to when  you're thinking about it, and they said, No, not really. And so I think we have lived in a community  where they have accepted it. And of course, we've been here all our lives, and maybe that makes a  difference. 

43:44 
They look beyond what color you are, what race you are, they look for the person. They definitely do.  So. I mean, sure. You'd have some people you know, look at the outside. 

43:59 
As roughly around two weeks, when a definite word came that we had to leave, we weren't going to be  able to stay the summer. We had talked about it ever since December 7, but it was middle of May when  I left and we had to just about two weeks notice to get everything in to get all your business in order.  Dispose of anything. I sold a refrigerator for $5. So pick up my teen 36 model Ford pickup for $50 and a  man who was I considered a good friend traded with me at a service station where I figured it was a 
good friend. He said I will send you the other 25 When you let me know when you get there your  address, which I did. I never did see him again. So I got $25 for 1936 pickup. 

45:02 
Well, the propaganda was that the Japanese were treacherous. You cannot trust them. They are bleep  that. See. So after that, that incident they give us the wish fricative we couldn't even leave Los Angeles  Did you know that they restricted us to the places place we lived. 

45:27 
household goods we just boarded up in a house and and left it is only allowed to take a suitcase of  peace. So we left with was just what we could carry. 

45:42 
One day we went in there, there was a drunken there, he saw us eating. He got on the table, start  preaching. He says we got to get rid of them. We got to kill them, causing us a lot of trouble. That was  us, who had nothing, just a fork and knife. And the guy was with he was man's in Khartoum. And I told  him, I said, you know, the book can be attacked, not by one person, but the whole mob here. 

46:10 
But it was a hellhole? Well, I felt that I didn't think it was right, really, because it was 

46:29 
they were supposed to be citizens and to be put into a place like that. And I guess, more or less thought  that they were entitled to more than that if they had to be put under some kind of security. So I didn't  think it was at all fair. 

46:50 
I gotten over the disappointment I had and went through hardships or went through on economy  evacuation. But there are people that need to know and people that would understand if they got the  story. What if they just read propaganda, and listen to it, and never been told. They would carry that on,  they'd be teaching that to their children and continuously grow. This experience that we went through  should never happen to any group of people. 

47:23 
I think this monument is long overdue, the Japanese American Citizens League supported it with  money. We support it as an educational tool. We support it as a reminder to all Americans of America's  rather sordid past, and we hope that it is a symbol of better times and better things to come. 

47:49 
As time goes on, Asian families have had to compromise between maintaining the traditions of the past  and adjusting to the culture of the present. Each group, each family and each individual must find a  comfortable balance between these two forces. 

48:12
They used to have what they call Japanese language summer schools here before World War Two.  And most of us attended those and we weren't taught the basics, how to read and write. But through  not using it. I have lost all of mine. 

48:45 
A lot of good culture from Japan. That mixed with the American culture it would help but I think the most  important thing that I taught my son was to respect the law. 

49:01 
Well said it might be children the children nowadays they call they call you by the name, first name first  name or something like that. Or but I teach these grandchildren to say we are their grandparents. And  they had to say grandparents to us whatever we want them Apple or Lolo or grandma or but really they  mostly are talking only in English that is my that is my my my mistake because I am not. I have not  taught them our dialect see with others. They they insist them to learn Mexican Chinese and Japanese  they teach them their dialect talk to them in during their infant days, you know, but me I never did to my  children or the grandchildren In fact, I, there was a comment one time that somebody read a, an article  that was written by my son in a magazine. And this, this friend told me, he has Shame on you, they  said, You, you have not even touched your child to speak your dialect. 

50:24 
Again, this is just because of me, but I've encouraged my kids to read, you know, I mark the stories and  say, Okay, you gotta read this, you know, when you're going to bed tonight, and, you know, I mean, I'm  going out, and I seek these books, and I'm, I'm one of them that was really strong in wanting to bring  some of the books into the library on on Asians. And when I'm making my donations, I, for example,  buy, there's a heritage book company out of Honolulu, and I'm, my, my donation this year, I'm going to  ask him to send and get some of these, you know, consider some of these books. 

51:03 
Very often speak to them about the Philippine traditions, how family relationships are not with the idea  that, hey, you gotta follow this, essentially, you know, this is how I was brought up. This is how things  would have been in the Philippines, or at least in my specific community. Again, as I said, not  specifically, Hey, you gotta follow this, because this is the Filipino way more more sharing my  experience with them. We asked them to make use of that the lesson or phase of life, as it would be  adapted to their, their society now or the place where they leave. 

51:54 
David is very interested in older kids is, is quite interested in being aware of, I guess you'd say the  Asian part of his heritage, like her 

52:05 
telling us what the stories were, we understood how they thought and how our code our code, through  those stories, I, I learned the culture of our background and stuff that was really good. 

52:21
They don't perceive themselves, any different from the other kids. And I think that's a very healthy,  healthy attitude, you know, and I think, I think they can weather anything, you know, that will come their  way having that kind of an attitude that, you know, I'm not, I'm a person like you, basically. Now, I'm not  saying they're color, blind, but you know, they know their heritage, but they're also asserting that I'm a  person first, before I'm a Filipino American, you know, and I think that's, you know, and I'm glad I'm  hearing that from all these kids. 

52:53 
Growing up with with my parents, it was a fairly typical American family where there wasn't a lot of real  closeness. And when you got to be 18, you left home, and you wrote every so often and went back on  major holidays, but there was not a real closeness. And going to the Philippines it was, it was really an  experience, being able to share that real tight cohesiveness that extends clear and to people that you barely even know. And that was very, very powerful to me, and I don't want my children to 

53:25 
lose. They have a sense of obligation and responsibility. And I've tried to impress that on my children,  not to forget when someone does you a favor, or helps you in any way. 

53:46 
America has often been called the melting pot, where immigrants from all over the world assimilate into  American society, losing the original cultural ties, or interviews with Asian Americans of Idaho, fit better  with a more recently proposed metaphor of a tossed salad, where each element retains its own distinct  flavor, but all combined into a single delicious experience. Certainly Idaho has become richer because  
of the contributions and hard work of the Asian Americans. Obtaining acceptance and recognition has  not been easy for them. But in spite of the struggles of starting life over in a strange land, and the pain  of the prejudice they have had to face, the people we spoke with place a high value on the beauty and  advantages of the state in which they live. One constant theme heard in all our interviews was that  
Idaho is my home 

54:47 
that I'd rather live in Nampa than anywhere else in Idaho someplace in anywhere else, especially  Western Idaho. 

54:55 
Far Pocatello goes I think it's a good time. I wouldn't be anywhere else. 

55:01 
I feel that Moscow and the University of Idaho and Washington state to help help our family to be what  we are. And Idaho is it's a very good state to be in and I although I we lived in my parents and I lived in  Washington for six years, but really, Moscow is my home.
