# _Africa Night_ ##

Another important student program is the Africa Night program, put on by the African Student Association, to “...showcase the various cultures of Africa using dance, music, poetry and food to show the face of Africa.”[^163] The organizers of this event, the African Student Association, or the ASA, are a group of International students from Africa whose purpose is to “...promote and preserve cultural heritage of Africans through activities and events.”  This event, with the Shades of Black event, have aimed to increase the education diversity at the campus, and they have been directed by the Black and African student populations on campus.
