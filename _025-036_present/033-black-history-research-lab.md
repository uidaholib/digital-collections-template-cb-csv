# _Black History Research Lab_ ##

The creation of inclusive spaces includes entities such as the Black History Research Lab, founded in 2021 by Dr. Sydney Freeman Jr., which was initially funded by the President’s Office and is currently funded by the History Department and the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences.[^167] The creation of the lab has been a tremendous effort undertaken at the University, allowing for stories of Black students and faculty to be brought forward and celebrated. The lab has been able to partner with the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning at the University of Idaho, which resulted in both the creation of a digital archive[^168] (for easier research purposes) and a physical exhibit that showcased some of the history to the community. This has allowed for a greater outreach on campus regarding race and has given a strong base from which new innovation can come forward for areas like Black faculty recruitment.
