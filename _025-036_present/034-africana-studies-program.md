# _Africana Studies Program_ ##

The idea of highlighting African culture and African diaspora is further accomplished by the Africana Studies Program.[^169] This program was developed in 2016 by Drs. Kristin Haltiner, Romuald Afatchao, and Sydney Freeman Jr. (note that it was developed by professors and not by senior leadership), and has sought to teach students to understand the history behind much of contemporary politics and racial relations today. Even though the program is newer and has not yet seen many graduates, it plays a vital role in helping diversify and educate students on campus.
