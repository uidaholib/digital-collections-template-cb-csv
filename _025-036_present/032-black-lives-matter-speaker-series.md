# _Black Lives Matter Speaker Series_ ##

The University also adopted the Black Lives Matter Speaker Series in 2020, which was funded by the Multicultural Affairs Office and other campus sponsors and  holds keynotes and workshops for . According to the organizers, the reason the series was created was “...for our campus and community to listen, engage and take action to dismantle systemic racism in our society.”[^166]  

The introduction of this series to campus in 2020, around the time of the murder of George Floyd, indicates that there was a desire to have more conversations about race on campus and that the University was undergoing change. The desire for change on campus from students and faculty has driven the University towards becoming a more inclusive space, and it has garnered more support from senior leadership than other programs have in the past.
